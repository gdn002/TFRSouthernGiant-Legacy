## This repository contains the files for the original "Early Access" version of TFRSG for archival purposes. TFRSG will be joining efforts with the "The South Burns" project, therefore the original project will be shelved indefinitely in favor of the new one.
## The following README is only kept for archival and currently does not represent future plans for TFRSG or TSB

#THE FIRE RISES: SOUTHERN GIANT

## Introduction
With the US in turmoil and the rest of the world powers fighting over their own spheres of influence, the nation of Brazil seemingly stands alone in a chaotic world. With the challenges wrought by Covid-19, an oil crisis and the descending of the world into extremist ideologies and wars, Brazil has a tough challenge ahead of itself: Will it avoid the fires, become a worthy leading force in South America and survive in the new world order? Or will it succumb to the fires and forge a new path for itself? But most importantly - will Brazil finally break its shackles and become the world power it had always been promised?

## Installing The Submod
- Place mod folder (TFRSouthernGiant) in "C:\Users\[Username]\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod\"
- In the mod folder, make a copy of "descriptor.mod", rename it "TFRSouthernGiant.mod" and place it in the same folder as before, at the same level as the mod folder itself
- Run HOI4 launcher and check if the mod is recognized

## Planned Content Roadmap
The following roadmap represents the planned content and scope of this mod, however as this is hobbyist work (as any modding work is) it should **not be taken as a confirmation or guarantee that said content will be developed**. Still, it is my intention to work towards it to the best of my capabilities and availability. This roadmap has also changed before the publishing of this repo and while I'm currently satisfied with where it's at, it may change again in the future. Finally, content beyond what's represented in the roadmap isn't off the table.

## Notes For TFR/Other Submod Devs
- This submod edits the base TFR map by adding in new provinces, states, VPs and strategic regions
- This submod overrides some base TFR files, in particular localisation/scripted locs to inject content and some event files to relay TFRSG-specific events from base TFR ones
- Don't expect this submod to be compatible with any other TFR submods. That said, I might make patches for common submods if there's the demand for it
