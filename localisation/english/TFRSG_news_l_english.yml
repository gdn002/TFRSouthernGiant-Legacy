 Brazil.timeline.6.t: "Carnaval Day"
 Brazil.timeline.6.d: "All over the country, the Brazilian people celebrate their lives in the nation's flagship holiday. The [GetYear] Carnaval has been marked by breathtaking shows at all the usual hotspot cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and Recife. Every year, in the period before Lent, Brazilians go out to the streets to party and celebrate, wearing unsual costumes and taking a break from their routines to be their most joyful selves.\n\nThe date is also marked by massive parades all over the country, featuring marching bands, dances, acts and the iconic floats. The main show was hosted at the Sambódromo Marquês de Sapucaí in Rio, where all the Samba Schools and Carnival Blocks presented to massive audiences and competed amongst themselves in the yearly Rio de Janeiro Carnaval contest.\n\nThis year's event wasn't all revelry and debauchery however - the parades also reflected the Brazilian people's political tendencies and polarizations. Many of the carnaval floats presented featured strong political messaging, mostly reflecting anti-racist, anti-fascist and anti-imperialist sentiments, albeit a few parades also featured opposing messages of pro-religious, pro-traditions thought. Ideological clashes were inevitable, but fortunately no serious incidents have been reported so far. It seems that Brazilians still value their enjoyment of Carnaval over political bickering."

 Brazil.timeline.9.t: "Love Wins In Brazil"
 Brazil.timeline.9.d: "Five-hundred and eighty days. That was how long president Lula da Silva spent in a jail cell, arrested for a crime he did not commit after being judged by a judge that had it out for him. That fated day, Lula was advised to hide, to run away, yet he stood firm and took it in stride. Many believed he would rot unjustly in prison, that the establishment would not come for him, that the people would have abandoned him. And yet, after these 580 days, Lula was not only made free again, but made innocent and embraced by the Brazilians he always loved.\nMany had lost hope in the Brazilian populace after the election of Jair Bolsonaro in 2018 under a platform of elitism and hate, assuming that was the true face of the people of Brazil. But it was a fluke, a desperate cry for help from a disenfranchised, helpless people who had their mandated government stolen from them with Dilma's impeachment and Lula's arrest. A cry that, unfortunately, had reached the wrong set of ears. But the Brazilians knew better than to give into this hatred and to come together as the world falls into chaos, to find strength in unity. A steep price was paid with the Covid-19 pandemic, and we still have a lot of work to do to purge the hatred from our society, but the people of Brazil are ready to forgive... And to be forgiven."

 Brazil.timeline.10.t: "A Return To Common Sense"
 Brazil.timeline.10.d: "Fortune awards those who wait. After the thaw of the military dictatorship, it seemed that Brazil finally had the chance to take off and become just like the US or Europe of the 90s. But sadly, our accrued economic and social debts set us back several decades, and coupled with the mistakes of the new republic, it led the Brazilians to lose hope in the neoliberal plan for the nation and as a result turn to more extreme ideas. The first two decades of the new millennium were the era of left-wing populism, it failed. Disilusioned Brazilians then turned to the far-right, and it also failed. It is said that politics is like a pendulum, always swinging from side to side, but we were able to put a stop to it and bring common sense back to the nation. No more polarization, no more extremism, just honest politics.\n\nWe mustn't become complacent, however. The people had been skeptical about centrism for a reason, and therefore we must analyze the mistakes of the 80s and 90s and ensure they are never repeated. For Alckmin isn't a return to a Brazil of old, but instead a chance for a new Brazil to be built, one that has learned from the past and is ready for the future."
 Brazil.timeline.10.a: "For the Brazilian nation, stability above all."
 Brazil.timeline.11.t: "A New Age For Brazil"
 Brazil.timeline.11.d: "In the right paths of life, you'll unavoidably make many enemies. We've had more than our fair share of enemies: the corrupt centrists, the degenerate communists, the self-centered Brazilian establishment. But we also have a very important ally in the patriotic Brazilian people! The pandemic couldn't stop us, the constant attacks couldn't leave a dent on us, the collapse of the world around us was not a concern. The Brazilians have decided to place all their trust in us regardless, and for that we owe them our eternal gratitude.\n\nLet us reward their loyalty with a national project that shall finally bring Brazil to greatness! Our patriotic military, our great farmers, our amazing people, all shall work together to rid this nation of everything that's wrong with it and build the greatest nation of the continent! Still, our enemies may be beaten but they are not defeated, so we must remain vigilant. This is not the end, it has just begun."

Many were not expecting we would have made it this far, and are now feeling adrift, pressured by the insurmountable responsibility of building a socialist state from the ruins of the old country.\nHowever, this responsibility is no reason for despair. For decades, Brazil has chased this foreign concept of a \"Country of The Future\" that has always felt just out of reach. Right now, Brazil's future is a blank canvas, one we finally get to paint for ourselves. Brazilians can allow themselves to dream of a true Brazilian future for the first time in their lives, a future by Brazilians, for Brazilians.\nThere's plenty of work to be done in rebuilding our country and establishing a fair state for all ahead of us, but we are Brazilians, and we never give up!"

 # News Events - Brazil
 Brazilnews.1.t: "Supreme Court Overturns Lula's Convictions"
 Brazilnews.1.d: "Brazil's Supreme Court minister Edson Fachin has overturned today all convictions imposed by the Federal Justice of Paraná on ex-president Luís Inácio Lula da Silva. The ex-president had been condemned on charges of corruption and money laundering in 2018 as part of Brazil's \"Car Wash\" anti-corruption investigations, which resulted in the suspension of his presidential campaign in the same year and his imprisonment. Fachin argued that there was not enough proof to form a conclusive case linking Lula to the fiscal irregularities that were under investigation, and also cited an abnormal assignment of judge Sérgio Moro to the case, who's been considered biased in the case. The overturn passed with 8 votes against 3 in the Supreme Court.\n\nLula, who had spent 580 days in prison and was released in early 2019 under claims of his arrest being inconstitutional, said in a press interview that he had always been certain of his innocence, that he was confident in the Brazilian process, and that \"the truth would win in the end\". The decision has proven controversial in Brazil's political and popular spheres, with many cheering the ex-president's release and claiming that justice has been done, while others condemn the decision and claim that Lula is still a criminal. Regardless, the decision restore Lula's political rights and means he would be allowed to run for the Brazilian office again."

 Brazilnews.2.t: "Manaus Fills Mass Graves as Covid-19 Hits The Amazon"
 Brazilnews.2.d: "As the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil worsens, a grim sight has taken place in the Amazonian city of Manaus. Around 300 bodies of Covid victims have been laid to rest in an improvised mass grave in the middle of the jungle. According to local authorities, the deathcare systems in the municipality have been overburdened by the sudden spike in fatalities.\n\nLocal citizens have been appaled at the development as they witness their friends and family buried en masse. \"They were just dumped there like dogs\" - said local Gabriel de Oliveira, whose spouse contracted the disease during a hospital procedure - \"What are our lives worth now? Nothing?\".\n\nManaus's mayor, Arthur Virgílio, has pleaded the international community for help. \"We aren't in a state of emergency... We're well beyond that\"."

 Brazilnews.4.t: "Lula da Silva Elected in Brazil!"
 Brazilnews.4.d: "With around 98% of votes tallied in the recent Brazilian 2022 general elections, Worker's Party candidate Luís Inácio Lula da Silva has been certified as the newest president elect of Brazil. This marks a historic moment in the country's political history, as Lula is the first Brazilian to be elected thrice as president. Reactions in the country have been split, with more progressive-minded Brazilians feeling ecstatic about their victory over the incumbent right-wing administration.\n\nIn a speech to his voters, Lula has thanked them and stated that his administration would see a return to the values of social democracy that led to Brazil's ascension in the 2000s and reaffirming that he cared for every Brazilian, regardless of ideological alignment.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle however, reactionary citizens and politicians have thus far refused to concede the results, claming that the electronic voting machines used in the elections were targeted by hackers in order to switch votes to Lula. Local analysts have expressed concern over the reaction to the elections, pointing to the ongoing crisis in the United States and warning of a possible similar development happening in Brazil."
 Brazilnews.4.a: "A star shines again!"
 Brazilnews.5.t: "Geraldo Alckmin Elected in Brazil!"
 Brazilnews.5.d: "The recent general elections in Brazil have resulted in a major upset, as centrist candidate Geraldo Alckmin has been confirmed winner, marking the return of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party to power after two decades. This has come as a shock to both many Brazilians and international observers, as all signs pointed to it being a fierce contest between progressives and reactionaries, with PSDB candidate Alckmin expected to maintain a solid third place.\n\nWhile analysts believe this could represent a desire of the Brazilian people to stay away from more extreme politics in an ever more unstable world, some also point out at Alckmin's connections with the Brazilian establishment and media conglomerates as a major force behind his campaign and subsequent victory.\n\nAlthough the majority of Brazilians seem content with this result, those at the fringes have refused to concede defeat, accusing Alckmin's campaign of being unfairly backed by Brazilian elites and engaging in corrupt tactics in order to win. The international community has expressed concern with this development, as it could mirror the recent US political crisis that resulted in a continental civil war in the country."
 Brazilnews.5.a: "A return to 90s Brazil?"
 Brazilnews.6.t: "Jair Bolsonaro Re-Elected in Brazil!"
 Brazilnews.6.d: "As the general elections in Brazil come to a close, it has been confirmed that incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro has secured his re-election. The right-wing conservative has had a troubled last two years in office, as Covid-19 ravaged Brazil, paired with the effects of the international oil crisis and also accusations of conspiracy. This culminated in 2021's \"Covid Trials\", where Bolsonaro was put to trial.\n\nHowever, the elections have proven that these events did little to damage Bolsonaro's or the right's reputation in the country, as the Brazilians have chosen for the continuation of his administration. In a speech to his followers, Bolsonaro proclaimed that he intends to make up for lost time and finish the project he started in 2018.\n\nOn the progressive side of Brazilian politics, accusations have been flung towards Bolsonaro wielding administrative powers to supress voters, specially in areas known to vote frequently for the Worker's Party. Analysts warn of a potential sucession crisis not unlike what has been witnessed in the US leading up to a complete civil war."
 Brazilnews.6.a: "The captain remains in command!"
 Brazilnews.7.t: "[get_bolsonaro_son_candidate] Elected in Brazil!"
 Brazilnews.7.d: "Interesting development today, as Brazilian authorities have confirmed the victory of candidate [get_bolsonaro_son_candidate] in the 2022 general elections. Current president Jair Bolsonaro has recently been the target of several investigations around his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as political conspiracy, culminating in last year's \"Covid Trials\" and a severe loss in ratings for the incumbent.\n\nJair's son [get_bolsonaro_son_candidate] was picked to run in his place in the elections, and while analysts had projected the newcomer candidate to come short of his father, the results have proven that Bolsonaro's project still holds, even without Jair in the presidential chair.\n\nBrazil's progressive wing has called out the candidature however, accusing [get_bolsonaro_son_candidate] of being merely a stand-in for Jair, who allegedly plans to govern as a shadow president through his son. Left-wing protests are being organized around the country, bringing fears of a repeat of the recent US political crisis and resulting conflict."
 Brazilnews.7.a: "Could this be the start of a political dynasty?"
 Brazilnews.8.t: "The Brazilian Republic Breaks Down"
 Brazilnews.8.d: "Following a recent overreach of the Brazilian military as it contained an insurrection attempt in Brazil's Federal District, armed conflict has been reported in the country's central regions. The insurrection developed from a series of riots against the results of the country's recent presidential elections, which escalated into bomb threats and the overruning of government buildings in the capital city of Brasília. The Brazilian Army moved in to secure the Federal District and enacted a state of siege, prompting centrist and progressive politicians to refuse travelling to the capital and instead forming an emergency government under a Lula-Alckmin coalition in the city of Rio de Janeiro, while Jair Bolsonaro and the military took over the seat of the former government.\n\nWith the collapse of the Brazilian government, several regions of the country have declared their own sovereign authorities. Most notably, the Northeastern region of Brazil has been taken over by the \"Brazilian Popular Front\", a coalition of left-wing parties that seek to overthrow the other two rival governments and unite Brazil under a new socialist state.\n\nMany see this as the latest chapter of the after-effects of the US Civil War, which has also led to similar collapses in Mexico and Colombia, as well as inter-nation conflicts in Central America. International authorities have expressed intention in sending humanitarian aid to the South American nation in crisis, but already find their supply lines stretched thin between the conflict in the USA, other conflicts throughout the world and tensions within their own local spheres."
 Brazilnews.8.a: "From North to South, The Americas burn."
 Brazilnews.9.t: "Federal Government Reunites Brazil"
 Brazilnews.9.d: "The Brazilian Civil War has been officially declared to be over earlier today, as the last pockets of insurrectionist and separatist movements have surrendered to the forces of The Brazilian Federal Government. In the months leading to the civil war, the federal government broad coalition was formed as a response to the military crackdown in the country's capital of Brasília, setting up a provisional administration in Rio de Janeiro under joint command by presidents Lula da Silva and Geraldo Alckmin.\n\nWhile most of the Brazilian army had sided originally with the military junta, the coalition had been able to hold off their offensive and conscript an army of its own thanks to the swift passing of political reforms and support from the international community, particularly from European nations. The federal government armies were then able to push into territories controlled by the junta as well as the revolutionary popular front after the successful passing of an UN resolution allowing direct intervention in Brazil.Many analysts have pointed out the shortcomings of the Brazilian Army and the successful military reforms passed by the coalition government as the main reason behind the outcome.\n\nWhile this conflict has undoubtely marked the lowest point in the history of the Federative Republic of Brazil, comparisons with the still ongoing Second American Civil War were inevitable, with the South American country having sustained great damages, but significantly less so than its North American counterpart. Still, Brazilians are jubilant with what has been called a \"victory of democracy\" for the country, and have expressed a deep desire for significant political reforms in the country to prevent a similar scenario from ever befalling the nation again. Only time will tell what shape the Brazilian Republic will be taking in its new age."

 Brazilnews.10.t: "Brazilian Military Administration Defeats Opposition"
 Brazilnews.10.d: "[BR2.GetLeader] has officially declared the Brazilian Civil War over in a statement to the nation this morning. The event was followed by a military parade in Brasília, where veterans of the civil war drove armored vehicles on a tour of the government buildings to a cheering crowd. The civil war had been kickstarted after a military crackdown in the country's capital following the insurrection protesting the results of the 2022 elections. The military declared the Federal District to be a special security zone, in what would eventually develop into the military administration that would eventually take over the rest of Brazil.\n\nTo many analysts, this came as no surprise as the overwhelming majority of the Brazilian Army sided with this administration, leaving the other factions poorly equipped to defend themselves. Many thought that the military junta would have been starved out by its lack of industrial capacity, its internal strifes and geographical isolation from any external assistance, but the army's strategy enabled it to secure key areas of the country and rout the opposition government and other insurrections in Brazil.\n\nWith [BR2.GetLeader]'s grip on the nation strengthened, the Brazilians are expecting a new era of authoritarianism and militarism for the country, similar to the two decades that followed the coup in 64. While many have expressed concerns of the erosion of rights and the establishment of a tougher dictatorship than the last one, some are hopeful that this outcome could instead lead to a thaw and much needed reforms to the Brazilian Republic."

 Brazilnews.11.t: "Popular Front Takes Over Brazil"
 Brazilnews.11.d: "The fighting has finally come to a stop in Brazil, as the revolutionary forces of the \"Brazilian Popular Front\" have declared victory over the other governments and secessionist states. The announcement was made in the provisional capital of Salvador and televised to households in the rest of the country, in which Popular Front leader Léo Péricles announced the consolidation of the Brazilian Revolution and the establishment of a socialist state in the country.\n\nThis outcome has baffled most analysts, which expected either of the two competing governments to be the one to declare victory. However, Marxist-aligned specialists have pointed out growing dissatisfaction with the Brazilian republican establishment and a rise in revolutionary rethoric in the country as the catalyst for their successful revolution. Leftist scholars around the world also praised the Popular Front's ability to unite several parties, act at the ground level and establish a vanguard party for the Brazilians to rally behind.\n\nInternational communist movements have shown ecstatic support for the Brazilian revolution and praised it as another sign of the \"end times for global capitalism\". The situation in Brazil isn't all celebrations, however, as the vanguard party now finds itself faced with the insurmountable task of rebuilding the war-torn nation in its own vision."

 Brazilnews.12.t: "Integralists Rise To Power In Brazil"
 Brazilnews.12.d: "Harrowing news from the country of Brazil have made the headlines today, as the far-right insurrectionist group \"Brazilian Integralist Front\" has seemingly defeated all other factions and breakaway governments and declared itself the victor of the conflict. The declaration was made by FIB leader Moisés Lima himself, in which he announced a project to \"return genuine patriotism and tradition to the Brazilian nation\" through the ideology of integralism.\n\nThe news has shocked analysts around the globe and has brought concerns to leaders of other South American nations, particularly more progressive-aligned ones. While Brazil has been left significantly devastated by its civil war and is expected to take a couple of years to recover, South American geopolitical analysts have sounded the alarm of Brazil's new turn to fascism potentially leading to massive inter-state conflicts in the continent.\n\nNews from Brazilian sources have been scarce, as many of the nation's mainstream press channels have allegedly been taken over by the new government. Refugees in neighboring countries have described an atmosphere of \"dread, but also compliance\" in the majority of the population."

 Brazilnews.13.t: "Monarchists Consolidate Power In Brazil"
 Brazilnews.13.d: "The Brazilian Civil War has finally met an unexpected conclusion, as the pro-monarchy insurrection led by the \"National Restoration Front\" has overwhelmed all other claimaints to the Brazilian government and appears to have reunified the nation under its banner. As fighting stopped, the UNR has announced their intention to immediately install a regency government in Brazil and elect a monarch to rule the nation. While they have yet to make their decision, it is highly expected that a member of the Brazilian Royal House of Orleans Braganza will be selected, as the group has exalted them as the rightful heirs to the throne in the past.\n\nThis outcome has led many political analysts to question their own theories, as the consensus had been that a return to monarchy in Brazil was a preposterous suggestion. The UNR originated as a social media group claiming to \"combat modern degeneracy\" and \"espouse the ideals of traditionalism in Brazil\", and while the group had an anemic mainstream presentation, it has become clear that it somehow managed to not only attain a significant following, but also coordinate its actions well enough to topple the other governments in Brazil. Some have pointed out, however, that this outcome is not necessarily proof of the group's coordination, but rather an one-in-a-billion historical coincidence.\n\nRegardless, it seems that the Brazilian nation is about to enter a new Empire era. What this means for South America and the rest of the planet remains to be seen."

 Brazilnews.15.d: "A mere three decades after the end of Brazil's period of military dictatorship, the nation has found itself back under the army's rule today as the Brazilian military has established control over the Brazilian administration. This development is the culmination of a series of events following the \"Covid Trials\" held in April of 2021, which resulted in the ousting of former president Jair Bolsonaro and the promotion of his vice-president Hamilton Mourão.\n\nMourão, a military politician, enacted stringent martial law measures to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic which had ravaged the country, as well as curb rising radicalization in the Brazilian population. The latest and most controversial measures taken as part of this process were the suspension of the 2022 elections and subsequent takeover of the political apparatus by the Brazilian military.\n\nPublic reactions to the development have been mixed, with parades being held both in support and protesting the military takeover, often resulting in street clashes. While a significant portion of the population has shown aprehension to the news and fears of a return to the dark days of the previous dictatorship era, the majority seems to have some hope that the new administration will maintain a \"business as usual\" approach this time."

 Brazilnews.libs.1.d: "This morning, a resolution has been passed during an emergency meeting in the provisional United Nations headquarters, called by Brazilian diplomats. The resolution calls for the recognition of the Rio Administration as the legitimate Brazilian government, U.N. assistance in the Brazilian territory and a symbolic permission for the Brazilian government to launch incursions into the hostile factions fighting over control of the country. The resolution passed with 137 votes, with permanent members Russia and China abstaining.\n\nAn U.N. peacekeeping operation is expected to take place in the nation soon, using French Guyana as a launching point and advancing through the native-controlled Amazonian lands. This operation is expected to coincide with a counter-attack from the Federal Government and an increase of foreign aid to the conflict. While Western nations have praised the initiative and displayed unrestricted support for the Rio Government, leaders in the Global South have shown a much more skeptical reaction to the resolution, pointing out the past crimes behind U.N. peacekeeping operations."

 latin_america.20.d: "Peru president Pedro Castillo has dissolved Congress and declared a \"state of exception\" following a judicial crisis in the country. The decree came moments before he was due to face an impeachment vote. Castillo argued that the Peruvian Congress has been serving oligopolistic interests and working with the Constitutional Court in order to undermine the executive branch's powers and create a \"congressional dictatorship\".\n\nThe move garnered a surprising amount of support from the president's coalition and popular supporters, leading to a deadlock in Congress and allowing Castillo's decree to take effect. The president also found an unexpected support from the Peruvian Armed Forces, who seemed unhappy with the rampant display of \"lawfare\" against the president and the executive, and have praised Castillo's willingness to \"bring some order to the house\".\n\nIn the public sphere, the decision was met with divided opinions, with many protests erupting and clashing with rallies in support of the president. While the situation seems to have stabilized for now, only time will tell if Castillo's experiment will last."

The day of high drama put an end to Castillo's tumultuous 17 months in power, which has already seen five cabinets, more than 80 ministers, six criminal investigations and two failed attempts to impeach him."
