 #-Intro
 BRA_second_half_of_bolsonaro: "The New Brazilian Project"
 BRA_second_half_of_bolsonaro_desc: "It was not long ago that the Brazilian people have taken to the streets to protest the careless administration of the Worker's Party. With Dilma ousted in 2016, and Bolsonaro elected in 2018, the people have expressed their desire for us to chart a new path for the country, a path of traditional values and hard work."
 BRA_political_tit_for_tat: "The Political Tit For Tat"
 BRA_political_tit_for_tat_desc: "The Brazilian president does not hold absolute power, for better or worse. If we are to bring our national project forward, we'll have to deal with the two other branches of the Brazilian government. The legislative presents our first obstacle and shall be tackled first."
 BRA_reshuffle_cabinet: "Reshuffle The Cabinet"
 BRA_reshuffle_cabinet_desc: "The Centrão insists on pushing their career politicians onto our cabinet in exchange for their support, but this is an obvious trap to muddle our ideological commitments and slow us down. Rather than giving into their demands, we shall fill our seats with true patriots, willing to give them all for the Brazilian cause."
 BRA_work_with_centrao: "Work With The \"Centrão\""
 BRA_work_with_centrao_desc: "There is no point in fighting the Centrão. Dilma tried, and she's gotten impeached for it. Politics is ultimately a game of compromise and extracting the most benefit from the establishment, so although it may seem like a betrayal of our cause, we must abide by its rules for now."
 BRA_purge_federal_police: "Purge The Federal Police"
 BRA_purge_federal_police_desc: "The pesky Federal Police has been breathing down our necks, ready to strike as soon as they smell anything that could be considered \"corruption\". How can we expect to run a government under such pressure? Fortunately, our power enables us to do something about it, by replacing key positions with more sensible people we can trust. We should expect some backlash, but doing so is a critical step in securing our administration against personal interests."
 BRA_rally_followers: "Rally Our Followers"
 BRA_rally_followers_desc: "We can't forget the patriotic voters who were responsible for electing us into power back in 2018. The people love their new leader and crave for a rally, so let's give them one they won't forget!"
 BRA_ministries_for_support: "Offer Ministries For Support"
 BRA_ministries_for_support_desc: "The most elementary way to build up support for a government in Brazil is to exchange positions in the different ministries for it. By strategically negotiating some less important seats, we can secure significant support without having to give up much power."
 BRA_secure_allies: "Secure Our Allies"
 BRA_secure_allies_desc: "If one falls, the entire house of cards falls. Thus, we must look after our own. Thankfully, we have major allies in the Brazilian Military providing more than enough cover for our government to do what must be done when the time comes. We just oughta reassert these commitments."
 BRA_give_up_chamber: "Give Up Chamber of Deputies Leadership"
 BRA_give_up_chamber_desc: "Giving up command of our government in the legislative to the Centrão is a risky move, but it is all but guaranteed to ensure their loyalty. We have other methods to enforce our authority anyway, so let them have this victory for now..."
 BRA_strong_presidency: "A Strong Presidency"
 BRA_strong_presidency_desc: "One way or the other, we have managed to not only successfuly navigate through the establishment, but come out of it stronger than ever. Our administration sees a strength that no other before us has been able to achieve! Very little stands in our way now..."
 BRA_dealing_with_little_flu: "Dealing With The \"Little Flu\""
 BRA_dealing_with_little_flu_desc: "Well, the novel coronavirus pandemic is now our problem as well. While this stalls our plan, we might be able to extract some benefit from this outbreak by rallying people around it. It's just a little flu anyway, how bad could it get?"
 BRA_fire_mandetta: "Fire The Health Minister"
 BRA_fire_mandetta_desc: "Our health minister Henrique Mandetta presents a conundrum. His ideas of \"lockdown\" and \"sanitary measures\" are the last thing we need right now. Not a problem though, we have a long list of people eager to replace Mandetta, we just have to find someone more in line with our methods."
 BRA_heed_mandettas_concerns: "Heed The Health Minister's Concerns"
 BRA_heed_mandettas_concerns_desc: "Although the health minister has proposed some deeply unpopular measures both with our supporters and Bolsonaro himself, he has proven his merit thus far. It may be a wise choice to swallow our pride and implement these measures in order to avoid the pandemic becoming worse."
 BRA_issue_lockdowns: "Issue Lockdowns"
 BRA_issue_lockdowns_desc: "Stay home! We can't have this outbreak spreading further. Sure, this may have grave impacts on the economy and peoples' daily lives, but we can sort that out later."
 BRA_grant_state_municipal_autonomy: "Grant State and Municipal Autonomy"
 BRA_grant_state_municipal_autonomy_desc: "Local authorities know what's best for their communities. Rather than implementing top-down federal measures, we will allow municipal and state governments some autonomy in how they choose to handle the outbreak. People are more likely to listen to their local representatives anyway."
 BRA_herd_immunity_policy: "Herd Immunity Policy"
 BRA_herd_immunity_policy_desc: "It's simple logic: You get sick, you develop immunity, you're no longer sick! And if enough people are immune, the whole herd becomes resistant to the virus. No need to gamble with unproven vaccines, just let nature take its course."
 BRA_contain_president: "Contain The President"
 BRA_contain_president_desc: "Despite our best attempts, a major thorn on our side in battling Covid-19 has been the president himself, who just seems unable to go a week without making a controversial statement or pushing for some bogus treatment. For his own sake and the sake of our nation, it'll be best if we reign him in until this all blows over."
 BRA_push_precocious_treatments: "Push For Precocious Treatments"
 BRA_push_precocious_treatments_desc: "Why wait until you catch the virus when you could treat yourself right now! Sure, these medications may have unproven efficacy, but the people need something they can place their trust in! It can only do good, right?"
 BRA_covid_stabilization: "Covid Stabilization Achieved"
 BRA_covid_stabilization_desc: "Our efforts are bearing fruit, as the Covid curve seems to be flattening. Whether that is due to the efficacy of our measures or a saturation of the pandemic is another topic. But for the time being, we can at least breathe a sigh of relief knowing that it won't be getting any worse."
 BRA_initiate_self_coup: "The Supreme Court Issue"
 BRA_initiate_self_coup_desc: "Before we can enact our national project for Brazil, one more obstacle has to be dealt with: The Brazilian Supreme Court, most specifically judge Alexandre de Moraes. The judge has been a thorn on our side throughout our administration, shooting down our moves and opening probes into our cabinet in search of anything that could be used to incriminate us. If we are to take him down, we must first paint him as the traitor to our nation that he is."
 BRA_initiate_self_coup_dummy: "$BRA_initiate_self_coup$"
 BRA_initiate_self_coup_dummy_desc: "$BRA_initiate_self_coup_desc$"
#-Covid Trials
 BRA_covid_trials_focus: "The Covid Trials"
 BRA_covid_trials_focus_desc: "It seems that the Covid-19 pandemic has opened a flank on our government that the opposition has exploited by installing a parliamentary inquiry committee, alleging that our response to the pandemic has been \"irresponsible\"! Unfortunately, we have no option but delay our plans, get through with these trials and hope for a favorable outcome."
 BRA_dealing_with_oil_crisis: "Dealing With The Oil Crisis"
 BRA_dealing_with_oil_crisis_desc: "The oil crisis has been left unchecked for too long. We must consider our options in how to deal with it, enact a plan and execute it before our internal economy deteriorates further from the inflated gas prices."
 BRA_secure_internal_gas_market: "Secure The Internal Gas Market"
 BRA_secure_internal_gas_market_desc: "Brazil has had enough oil reserves to achieve fuel autarky for over a decade, yet our lack of refining capabilities and control over the state company of Petrobrás have left us still reliant on imports to maintain our refined oil market. The ongoing oil crisis has shown the consequences of this deficiency, leaving our economy in shambles while truly self-suffient nations like Russia have been left unscathed. We must work towards a similar self-sufficiency, even if the liberal elites oppose it."
 BRA_capitalize_oil_crisis: "Crisis Capitalization"
 BRA_capitalize_oil_crisis_desc: "Brazil is a major crude oil exporter, and by all means this oil crisis should be a boon to us. Yet, state meddling in Petrobrás and our dependency on refined gas imports have offset any possible gains we could be making in the current international oil market. We have devised a two-step plan towards overcoming this crisis: Loosen some of the state control on Petrobrás to enable more profitable export deals, and seek more advantageous import deals in this changing global scenario."
 BRA_increase_state_share_petrobras: "Increase State Share on Petrobrás"
 BRA_increase_state_share_petrobras_desc: "Currently, Petrobrás is a mixed-capital enterprise, with half of its shares directly held by the government. While this does make us the majority stakeholder, it does not provide for as strong of control as we could have. Fully statizing Petrobrás right now would be out of the picture, but we could increase our stake in the company, enough to give us defacto control over it. This will be a costly process, but it should pay in the long term."
 BRA_enact_price_controls: "Enforce Gas Price Controls"
 BRA_enact_price_controls_desc: "Yes, oil is more expensive now. But we also can't ignore the impact of the gas station cartels all over our cities whom have taken advantage of the crisis to price gouge consumers beyond what's reasonable. If we're to overcome this crisis, we'll need to clamp down on exploitation in the internal gas market and keep gas prices under control via policing and subsidies."
 BRA_liberalize_petrobras: "Liberalize Petrobrás"
 BRA_liberalize_petrobras_desc: "Petrobrás is a Brazilian oil production behemoth, chained down by government bureaucracy, regulations and demands that it is forced to comply with due to the government's majority share. Not only does this hold back the company itself, it also disencourages investors at a time where oil shares could be at a premium. We shall open up Petrobrás to private investors and allow them to have as much of a say in the company as the government does!"
 BRA_drop_import_parity_policy: "Drop Import Parity Policy"
 BRA_drop_import_parity_policy_desc: "Petrobrás import parity policy means that regardless of cost, internal gas prices must be pegged to the international market value of oil. What this means is that the Brazilian people are at the mercy of the international gas market even as we work towards autarky. Brazilian gas is for the Brazilians first, and if we can produce it cheap, it should be sold cheap!"
 BRA_look_to_russian_oil: "Oil Deals With Russia"
 BRA_look_to_russian_oil_desc: "With the Middle East in flames and the US breaking down, we must seek new trade partners to overcome our refined oil dependency. Our partner in BRICS, Russia, has had countless sanctions put in place by the Western world, meaning they hold immense oil reserves but have a limited array of buyers for that oil. Seems like a mutually beneficial deal could be arranged."
 BRA_oil_crisis_weathered: "The Oil Crisis Weathered"
 BRA_oil_crisis_weathered_desc: "After so long, it finally seems that the oil crisis is ending in Brazil. Gas prices are gradually coming down, and with it so are transportation costs and the cost of living. This comes as a great relief for the Brazilian people, and to get it done just in time for the elections is a great plus!"
 BRA_covid_recovery_policy: "Covid Recovery Policy"
 BRA_covid_recovery_policy_desc: "The coronavirus has been left rampant in Brazilian society so far, but there's light at the end of this tunnel. With the CoronaVac vaccine entering its trial phases, a return to normality seems closer than ever. We have plenty of work to do still, as we must first contain the outbreak and deploy the vaccine throughout the country."
 BRA_centralize_covid_response: "Centralize Covid Response"
 BRA_centralize_covid_response_desc: "If we want to recover from this pandemic as quickly as possible, we'll need a response at the federal level. This will require passing some temporary laws and will absolutely prove unpopular with the Brazilian people who have been used to their local guidelines so far, but is the best way to guarantee a swift return to normality."
 BRA_continue_state_autonomy: "Maintain State-Level Autonomy"
 BRA_continue_state_autonomy_desc: "The existing system of providing autonomy for local administrations to handle Covid-19 as they see fit has worked well for us, and there's no point on moving away from it. Sure, it has been a slow recovery. Sure, some of the governments have been slacking. But it has prevented further upheaval, which has been just as important as preventing the virus from spreading."
 BRA_enact_martial_law: "Declare Martial Law"
 BRA_enact_martial_law_desc: "Our country is in chaos, but fortunately we have a General in charge. Rather than going through the slow motions of politics and party bickering, this situation calls for a treatment at its core. We shall enact martial law to force the Brazilian society into isolation in order to contain the spread of both the virus and radicalization, and then deploy the military in a humanitarian effort to end this pandemic once and for all."
 BRA_relax_coronavac_regulations: "Relax CoronaVac Research Regulations"
 BRA_relax_coronavac_regulations_desc: "The CoronaVac research effort has been hampered by a lot of red tape, and while such regulations have their place, our extraordinary circumstances call for a hastening of the process, even if some guidelines must be trampled through in the process. We can expect some backlash from the already vaccine-skeptic parts of the population, but it's better for them to be skeptical than dead."
 BRA_nationwide_lockdowns: "Nationwide Lockdowns"
 BRA_nationwide_lockdowns_desc: "We cannot afford to have the virus spreading throughout society any longer. It might be an unpopular measure, but we shall pass temporary federal laws mandating lockdowns in all urban centers in the countries."
 BRA_contact_tracing_measures: "Contact Tracing Measures"
 BRA_contact_tracing_measures_desc: "Pandemics have evolved in the 21st century, but so have our methods of dealing with them. By making use of tracking history data provided by people's smartphones, we're able to trace the spread of Covid-19 by those infected and pre-emptively quarantine potential future cases before they get the chance to spread it further."
 BRA_send_aid_remote_states: "Send Aid to Remote States"
 BRA_send_aid_remote_states_desc: "Many remote areas in Central and Northern Brazil lack the resources and facilities to handle the pandemic on their own. Overcoming Covid-19 in Brazil means overcoming it in every part of the country, and therefore it is our responsibility to help these less fortunate states in this process."
 BRA_issue_mask_mandates: "Issue Mask Mandates"
 BRA_issue_mask_mandates_desc: "While local authorities are free to combat the Covid-19 spread as they see fit, we in the federal government need not remain idle. A few limited guidelines such as mandating mask use in government facilities will go a long way in slowing down the spread and speeding up recovery."
 BRA_combat_covid_fake_news: "Fight Covid Fake News"
 BRA_combat_covid_fake_news_desc: "One of the major obstacles in fighting this pandemic comes not from the virus itself, but from society. Fake news are rampant everywhere, and the Covid-19 pandemic has not been spared of being the target of such efforts. We need to flank these media efforts with our own and combat this disinformation if we want our measures to be effective."
 BRA_social_media_monitoring: "Social Media Monitoring"
 BRA_social_media_monitoring_desc: "By closely monitoring social media posts by the Brazilian population, we can curb dissent, combat disinformation around the pandemic and our government, and keep track of cases all at once. Sure, there might be concerns about \"privacy\" and \"government overreach\", but if people are willingly giving out this information to the public, why shouldn't we make use of it?"
 BRA_enforce_curfews: "Enforce Curfews"
 BRA_enforce_curfews_desc: "The Brazilian people will not simply abide by lockdowns, they must be enforced. From now on until the pandemic is declared over, soldiers shall patrol the streets in major urban centers and anyone found outside without a valid warrant will be escorted back to their home."
 BRA_covid_field_hospitals: "Set Up Covid Field Hospitals"
 BRA_covid_field_hospitals_desc: "Our public healthcare system is overwhelmed by the amount of Covid cases, to the point that other patients are forced to stand in line in order to get their treatment. We shall ease the burden by setting up temporary field hospitals that will treat these cases, allowing the clinics and hospitals some room to breathe."
 BRA_brazil_united_against_covid: "Brazil United Against Covid!"
 BRA_brazil_united_against_covid_desc: "\"The Coronavirus is not just an individual problem. It is a societal problem.\nIt doesn't just lead to coughing, dizziness and weakness. It leads to closure of businesses, loss of jobs and the overloading of health services.\nIt is not just fought via individual precautions, but by working together against the virus.\nWe are a country of over 200 million people. If we all work together, this virus has no chance at beating us! Follow higiene guidelines, stay at home whenever possible, pay attention to vaccination schedules in your area and if you have symptoms, take measures to isolate the spread and contact local health authorities.\nBrazil, united against covid.\""
 BRA_covid_each_does_their_part: "Each Does Their Part Against Covid!"
 BRA_covid_each_does_their_part_desc: "\"Marcos has been working from home to avoid exposing himself to Covid.\nJulia wears a mask whenever she's outside to stop the spread.\nGabriel has temporarily given up eating out in favor of getting his meals delivered.\nEveryone protects themselves in any way they can. It's the little things, all added up, that make the difference! Follow your local guidelines, stay inside or wear a mask whenever possible and stay informed on the availability of vaccines in your area.\nWe are in this together, and each of us must do their part against Covid!\""
 BRA_military_our_defenders: "The Military: Defending Us From Covid!\""
 BRA_military_our_defenders_desc: "\"Our streets are kept safe by soldiers.\nOur government, made efficient by military officers.\nThe doctor providing care to Covid patients? An army medic.\nThe Brazilian Army is more than just soldiers. It is the driving force of the Brazilian society during these trying times. When you need help, we'll be there to serve you. When we need your help, make sure to listen. We will overcome this, together.\nThe military: defending us from Covid."
 BRA_covid_eradicated_focus: "On The Way to Eradicate Covid"
 BRA_covid_eradicated_focus_desc: "Finally, after toiling for two years under this accursed pandemic, it finally seems that Brazil is about to turn the page on it. While many Brazilians lost their lives to Covid, and they shall be mourned, for the rest of us life carries on."
 BRA_2022_campaign_trail: "The 2022 Election Campaign Trail"
 BRA_2022_campaign_trail_desc: "With our internal problems sorted out, we can finally direct our attention towards the elections just a couple of months away from now. Get on the campaign trail, it's sure to be a bumpy ride!"
 BRA_2022_suspend_elections: "Suspend The 2022 Elections"
 BRA_2022_suspend_elections_desc: "With the world going up in flames and Brazil having just barely made it this far without falling apart, it's becoming clear that our republican establishment is not prepared for the challenges that lie in our near future. What the country needs right now is a strong, strategic administration, one above petty political bickering and ideology. One that only the Brazilian military high command can provide."
 #-Election Trail
 BRA_the_2022_race: "Brazil's Most Decisive Elections"
 BRA_the_2022_race_desc: "Brazil's future stands at a crossroads. Progressives, centrists and reactionaries all fight for control of the country, and the population is the most polarized it has ever been. Whoever gets elected this season is sure to determine the path that the country will take for the next decade.\nHowever, this year's elections aren't just a matter of which political faction gets in control. The recent chaos in the US has shown us that the very fate of our republic could be at stake. Will Brazilian democracy hold?"
 BRA_2022_together_for_brazil: "Together For Brazil!"
 BRA_2022_together_for_brazil_desc: "With Lula da Silva's political rights restored, it's time to make up for lost ground. Bolsonaro's election in 2018 was an anomaly only made possible after repeated attacks on the democratic process, and it's become more than clear that his reactionary project for the nation has failed. The people rally for a return of a government that truly cares for the working poor, one that Lula and the Worker's Party has already shown capable of providing."
 BRA_2022_uniting_brazil: "Brazil, United!"
 BRA_2022_uniting_brazil_desc: "The interruption of the neoliberal Brazilian project has been perhaps the biggest mistake the country has commited since the turn of the millennium. What we got out of it has been just endless party bickering between the spendthrift left and the uncouth right. It is not too late to correct course however, and Geraldo Alckmin is the man to get us out of the trap of radical politics!"
 BRA_2022_god_country_family: "God, Country, Family"
 BRA_2022_god_country_family_desc: "Bolsonaro's debut term in the executive might have been a bit rough, but if anything it has been proof of his ability to remain resolute and rational in the face of a crisis. With the world seemingly going up in flames as the US burns, the Brazilians will need a strong authority figure in charge, a captain that can guide this ship through the turbulent waters. Bolsonaro is that captain."
 BRA_2022_reinvigorate_social_democracy: "Reinvigorate Social Democracy"
 BRA_2022_reinvigorate_social_democracy_desc: "The Brazil of today is not the same it was 20 years ago. While many of our previous achievements have been undermined by the reactionary factions in the government and will need to be reinstated, we can't simply expect to reheat our old rethoric and get the same results. The Brazilian people expect more of us this time around, and we show them that we are capable of delivering."
 BRA_2022_mingle_with_popular_front: "Mingle With The Popular Front"
 BRA_2022_mingle_with_popular_front_desc: "The Brazilian Popular Front is a blessing to our side that we must not squander. While their ideologies might be unpalatable to our more moderate supporters, their ability to rally the people towards our cause and provide strong support to our future government is more than worth the investment."
 BRA_2022_sideline_popular_front: "Sideline The Popular Front"
 BRA_2022_sideline_popular_front_desc: "While the support of the Brazilian Popular Front is appreciated... The unfortunate reality is that we cannot expose ourselves to the opposition by associating with them. This is already an extraordinary moment of raised tensions and radicalism in Brazilian politics, and we should not be adding more fuel to the fire right now."
 BRA_2022_grassroots_campaigns: "Grassroots Campaigns"
 BRA_2022_grassroots_campaigns_desc: "Vem pra rua! Sure, social media is the new game and television remains strong, but nothing compares to assembling huge, street-crowding political rallies and talking directly to your supporters. It is a lot of work, sure, but it pays off and showcases our commitment to the Brazilian people."
 BRA_2022_stand_for_normalcy: "Stand For Normalcy"
 BRA_2022_stand_for_normalcy_desc: "On the heels of a pandemic and with tensions rising all around the world, the biggest question in the minds of the Brazilians right now undoubtely is whether or not their lives could possibly return to a sense of normalcy. Our electoral campaign should revolve around answering this question."
 BRA_2022_gather_centrao_support: "Gather Centrão Support"
 BRA_2022_gather_centrao_support_desc: "The center may lack the support in the presidential race that the other candidates lack, and the ability to rally forth our supporters, but we have something that neither of the other candidates possess: consensus. With the right deals, we can make sure that the overwhelming majority of Brazilians have a local representative endorsing Alckmin for president!"
 BRA_2022_propaganda_overdrive: "Propaganda Overdrive"
 BRA_2022_propaganda_overdrive_desc: "Propaganda is what wins elections! And we just so happen to have good ties with the biggest television broadcaster in the country, TV Globo. Some key talking heads here, some subtle ideological tweaking there, and before you know it the whole country will rally behind our ideals!"
 BRA_2022_cruzade_for_brazil: "Cruzade For Brazil"
 BRA_2022_cruzade_for_brazil_desc: "In order to win this election, we need to let the Brazilian people know what's at stake - not merely a presidential term or petty ideology, but the very integrity of our nation in times where both foreign and domestic enemies flank us from all sides. This is a Cruzade for the future of our country!"
 BRA_2022_moderated_tone: "Moderated Tone"
 BRA_2022_moderated_tone_desc: "Let's be frank, a lot of the trouble our administration went through could have been avoided had the president known when to not speak his mind. While the unfiltered version of Bolsonaro had been very popular up until 2020, times have changed and the people have become more politically aware. It may seem like a betrayal of our ideals, but at least for now, we must maintain a moderated tone and reach out towards the center."
 BRA_2022_no_holding_back: "No Holds Barred"
 BRA_2022_no_holding_back_desc: "If there is one thing our first term has shown us, is that there is no point in reigning in your ideals for the sake of compromise in the Brazilian republican system. The opposition will criticize you and the center will hold you hostage to their whims no matter what. This time we shall release all the brakes and leave no doubt of where our project is headed and who our enemies are."
 BRA_2022_social_media_campaign: "Social Media Campaigning"
 BRA_2022_social_media_campaign_desc: "The left has failed to capture the online space, which is where our ideas still reign strong. Livestreams, podcasts, online articles and even mere social media posts, we shall go all in on online campaigning and make sure all of Brazil is talking about us! Even bad publicity is still good publicity."
 BRA_2022_the_last_stretch: "The Last Stretch"
 BRA_2022_the_last_stretch_desc: "As election day approaches, it's becoming clearer and clearer that this heavily disputed race will be a close one. We must consider all our options to sway voters away from the opposition, even those that might be on the edge of fairness and legality. Better to ask for forgiveness later than permission now."
 #-Elections Suspended
 BRA_2022_give_the_order: "Give The Order"
 BRA_2022_give_the_order_desc: "It is time to call on the Brazilian military high command and give them the order. All federal matters are to be put under military control, all members of congress, state and municipal administration now respond to the new administration. We can expect pushback from both the population and the ruling class, so our soldiers should be at the ready to suppress any subversive behavior during this transitional period."
 BRA_2022_crackdown_on_protests: "Crackdown On Protests"
 BRA_2022_crackdown_on_protests_desc: "As expected, the establishment is not bowing down without a fight. Opposition politicians have already rallied up their supporters, stoking fears of a \"second military dictatorship\" and propagandizing the mistakes of the past regime. While it is important we combat misinformation, we must first secure our grip in the country by pacifying these protests before they can grow into something more dangerous."
 BRA_2022_control_the_opposition: "Control The Opposition"
 BRA_2022_control_the_opposition_desc: "In order to stabilize the country, we must end dissent at its roots. The leaders of our opposition have enjoyed the relative comfort and safety of their soapboxes while they sent their supporters to do the dirty work, but all it takes are the right string pulls for them to fold like the pathetic dogs they are. They can either be with us, or against us."
 BRA_2022_suppress_the_media: "Suppress The Media"
 BRA_2022_suppress_the_media_desc: "The liberal media apparatus has been spinning non-stop since we declared the suspension of the elections, which is problematic for us. Fortunately, big broadcasters like Rede Globo and Record speak a language we can all understand: the language of capital. With the correct investments, they will gladly broadcast whatever messages we need. And if it needs be, we can always threaten to turn off the faucet for some added incentive."
 BRA_2022_shut_down_chamber: "Shut Down The Chambers of Congress"
 BRA_2022_shut_down_chamber_desc: "The Brazilian Congress represents everything that's wrong with the republican establishment. A bunch of elite riff-raff that can never agree on anything except that they must line their own pockets. If we want this country to move forward, we must dismantle this structure and assume direct control. The army knows what's best for this country."
 BRA_2022_repurpose_republican_apparatus: "Co-opt The Republican Establishment"
 BRA_2022_repurpose_republican_apparatus_desc: "Why dismantle the government when we can repurpose it instead? The Brazilian republican establishment, for all its faults, enables the Brazilian people to feel like their voices are heard most of the time. Not only that, it also facilitates international diplomacy in the era of globalization we find ourselves in."
 BRA_2022_consolidate_the_coup: "Consolidate The Coup"
 BRA_2022_consolidate_the_coup_desc: "Without firing a single shot, we have achieved that which we have waited so long for. The Brazilian nation is once again under the rule of its army, and we have been given a second chance to make things right. In such uncertain times, with the hegemon of the world burning, we Brazilians must be prepared to face challenges unlike anything we have seen before. The Brazilians should count themselves lucky for having a competent military in charge."
 #-Election Aftermath
 BRA_2022_love_wins: "Love Wins!"
 BRA_2022_love_wins_desc: "The 2022 election results have been certified, and our winner is Lula da Silva by the Worker's Party! Progressive Brazilians rejoice as what they see as the greatest injustice of this millennium seems to be finally rectified with the return of the big daddy to power. Still, the opposition isn't going to take these news in stride. They have prepared for this outcome and have been sowing uncertainty about the results of the election for months."
 BRA_2022_bolsonarisms_last_stand: "Bolsonarism's Last Stand"
 BRA_2022_bolsonarisms_last_stand_desc: "Bolsonaro may have been defeated at the electronic voting booth, but his reactionary cult is still very much alive and preparing its last stand. Emboldened by Trump's display in the Second American Civil War, these protesters present a real threat to our democracy should their actions not get addressed."
 BRA_2022_no_time_for_hate: "No Time For hate"
 BRA_2022_no_time_for_hate_desc: "Now is not the time for hate, but for love and unity. The Brazilians have made their voices heard, and the majority has called for Lula. That doesn't make the rest losers though - if we as a nation can get over our ideological differences and work together, we can rest assured the new government will take care of all of us."
 BRA_2022_stand_firm_and_stand_by: "Stand Firm And Stand By"

 BRA_systemic_corruption_idea: "Systemic Corruption"
 BRA_systemic_corruption_idea_desc: "Every Brazilian knows that since they were born, they were governed by a corrupt ruling class. While political corruption is nothing new under the sun for pretty much every country on Earth, Brazil's corruption appears to have taken deep roots throughout the whole of society, from the top politicians and billionaires all the way to small businesses and working class individuals. The so called \"Brazilian Way\" has led to a society with a poor moral compass, and although there are disagreements on how, everyone agrees that it must be dealt with."

 BRA_not_world_power_idea_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_BRA_power_of_the_future\n\n\n\n\n\nEver since the turn of the millennium, Brazil has been referred to as the \"country of the future\" countless times. Thanks to the commodities boom of the 2000s, the country saw significant economic and social improvements and was even able to weather the 2008 depression, but all good times eventually come to an end. With the boom tapering off in 2014, economic and political crisis followed, and Brazil's dreams of becoming a superpower were put on hold. Some blame this on our own alleged shortsightedness and incompetence, while others accuse the international superpowers of subverting Brazil's interests, but one thing is certain: Within every Brazilian, there is a deep desire to see their nation finally take off and become the §H\"Country of the Future\"§! that was promised."
 BRA_country_of_today_idea: "Country Of Today"
 BRA_mass_homicide_idea: "Mass Homicides"
 BRA_mass_homicide_idea_desc: "It's no secret that Brazil always finds itself at the very top of international homicide rankings. Warring criminal factions, a lack of effective policing and a particularly violent society are some of the usual culprits. Many solutions have been presented for this problem by the many political wings, from tougher policing to socio-educational reforms, but political inertia has led to mostly half-hearted attempts at best in the past."
 BRA_disjointed_geography_idea: "Disjointed Geography"
 BRA_disjointed_geography_idea_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_BRA_disjointed_geography\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a post-colonial continental-sized nation in one of the most geographically-challenging parts of the world, Brazil is a poorly-interconnected country. The late 50s saw a push for automobile-centered infrastructure construction and the abandonment of the nation's railwail networks under president Juscelino Kubitschek. This infrastructure would prove difficult to build and maintain across the hilly terrains, deep jungles and marshes that make up the country, leaving pheripheral regions such as the Amazonian jungle poorly linked to the nation's central areas."
 BRA_agricultural_society_idea: "Agrarian Society"
 BRA_agricultural_society_idea_desc: "From colonial times to today, Brazil's economy has been mostly agrarian. The plantation lords of colonial times have been mostly replaced by large agricultural corporations nowadays, but many argue that the dynamic hasn't changed much between the two. A deep §Ragrarian reform§! or §Yindustrialization push§! would be essential in freeing Brazil from its agricultural dependency, but facing the strong opposing interests of these business sectors is a tough prospect for any politician."

 BRA_rise_of_evangelism_idea_desc: "While Brazil is home to a diverse set of religious beliefs, it is still a majority Christian country. Catholic Christians still hold a majority, but the last few decades have seen the steady rise of Evangelicals, who are set to become the dominant group this decade. This transition has been capitalized on by conservative and reactionary movements who preach for a return to traditional family and religious values, and was in great part responsible for the election of figures such as Jair Bolsonaro. This trend has also accompanied a rise in religious radicalization and the advent of \"megachurches\" in the country, which are often ran by celebrity pastors and accused of leeching funds from the common men and women."
 BRA_self_indulgent_military_idea: "Self-Serving Brazilian Army"
 BRA_self_indulgent_military_idea_desc: "Considering that Brazil endured two decades under harsh military rule with more than its fair share of corruption, censorhip and torture, Brazil's military has gotten away with naught but a slap in the wrist. The Amnesty Law of 79 shielded officers from their crimes, and the military as a whole never saw any sort of institutional repercussion or reform as a consequence, with the post-military regimes instead opting to sweep everything under the rug and let bygones be bygones.\nThis led to the Brazilian high command becoming complacent and self-indulgent over the years, enjoying a plethora of perks and soft control over the nation's politics. Not only this leads to inflated costs, but also a less than competent cohort equipped with outdated hardware. It is a common joke in Brazilian society that our military is only ever good for painting curbs.\nAs the future of the world becomes more and more uncertain, we would be wise in reforming our military instutitions lest we get caught unprepared in a major conflict."
 BRA_reformed_military_idea: "Reformed Brazilian Army"
 BRA_reformed_military_idea_desc: "Through simple reforms, our military has had a lot of its bloat trimmed out and some sense of meritocracy put into it. While its past sins have had to go unchecked for the time being, the reformed Brazilian Army seems content with the new norm and less inclined to engage in any democracy-defying campaigns in the near future. Still, we must always remain vigilant, for this military reform is a continuous process."
 BRA_rebellious_military_idea: "Rebellious Brazilian Army"
 BRA_rebellious_military_idea_desc: "The repeal of the 1979 Amnesty Law was like forcefully ripping the bandaid off the military's dark past, and as expected it came with severe pains. Our high command is threatening a mutiny, and are spreading this sentiment to our soldiers through ideologically-charged fearmongering. Our civilian population on the other hand has had an overwhelmingly positive response to these reforms, enough to force the army to not get any ideas for the time being. As a new standard gets set for our military, we expect these turbulent times to pass, and the Brazilian Army to improve from it."
 BRA_new_brazilian_military_idea: "The New Brazilian Army"
 BRA_new_brazilian_military_idea_desc: "For decades, our military has been a parallel state, working for its own interests in detriment of the Brazilian government and its people. But finally, this era is over and a renewed Brazilian Army has taken the place of the old, oligarchic and decadent cohort. Our new military is competent, modernized and most importantly, trained to defend the Brazilian nation above all else.\n\n§GDesta vez, a cobra vai fumar!§!"

While this allows our population to stay afloat even under a shrinking job market, these forms of work seldom pay enough to comfortably cover the cost of living, forcing these individuals to either take on multiple jobs at once or take on debts just to sustain themselves.

 #Summary
 BRA_country_summary: "§YCountry Summary§!:\nThe biggest economy in Latin America, and the second largest economy in the Americas only below the behemoth that is the US, Brazil has always been viewed as a nation full of potential. Unfortunately, that's all that there has ever been - potential. Coming out of WW2 with a craving for republicanism and development, Brazil had its ambitions cut short in 1964 when the military took over its institutions and enacted two decades of oppression.\nAs the military regime thawed, Brazil would once again dare to dream in the new millennium powered by a commodities boom wrought by the rise of new emerging powers. But this dream would again escape Brazil's grasp when the boom ended and with it Brazil's economic and political stability, culminating in the 2016 impeachment of president Dilma Roussef and a reactionary shift with Jair Bolsonaro.\nWith the entire world at the brink, the nation faces tough challenges ahead, but also plenty of opportunities. Could this finally be the time for Brazil to rise up and become the power of the future it has always craved to be?"

 Brazil.1.t: "The Forever Country of The Future"
 Brazil.1.d: "Brazil is described by many things. Soccer. Carnaval. Sunny beaches, favelas and corruption. But perhaps the best way to describe Brazil is the moniker of \"Country of The Future\". Thirty-five years ago, the military regime that had haunted us for two decades had finally thawed, and the Sixth Brazilian Republic was born. While this republic had a bumpy ride at first, compensating for the shortfalls wrought by the dictatorship years and worldwide financial instability, we managed to arrive into the new millennium mostly in one piece.\n\nWith the new millennium, came new challenges, new ways of thinking, and new opportunities. The global commodities boom combined with the Worker's Party developmentalist policies put us on the road to becoming the country of the future. But our bloated, corrupt establishment slowed us down, and before we could live up to the hype, the boom was over and with it so was the dream.\n\nSo the Brazilian people called for change, and did it come. The new administration is the complete antithesis to what came before, exchanging developmentalism for austerity and progressivism for tradition. But so far, it has been more of the same with a different coat of paint. Brazil's issues run deeper than what a mere political party switch can solve. If we really want to live up to the hype, we'll need to fight the root cause of our problems, or otherwise be doomed to be the forever country of the future."
 Brazil.1.a: "És belo, és forte, impávido colosso, e o teu futuro espelha essa grandeza."
 Brazil.2.t: "Everything Going to Plan"
 Brazil.2.d: "It is often joked that the Brazilian year does not start proper until after the Carnaval, and as summer finally comes to a close the Brazilian people prepare to go back to their usual lives in the new decade. But within the Palácio do Planalto, the Brazilian presidential palace, the first few weeks of 2020 have been ones of intense discussions. In particular, the same question that every elected president always had at some point in their career could not leave Jair Bolsonaro's mind: What's the problem with Brazilian politics?\n\nSurely if you asked him, the answer would seem obvious - the Worker's Party and their corruption. But they were out of the picture now, and it was Bolsonaro's time to shine. And yet, it seemed that they hadn't moved forward an inch. The socialists, the liberals, even the military, they all had their shot at handling things and yet they all fell short. Was his own project fated to the same outcome?\n\nEven though Bolsonaro refused to fully admit, deep down he knew that the issue ran deeper than just mere ideology. It was the establishment itself that had held everyone back for so long. Self-serving interests running everything from the shadows and keeping a puppet show in Brasília. You either played to the tune, or you'd be discarded, like happened with Dilma.\n\nBut what if he could be the one to finally cut the strings and become a true sovereign leader?"
 Brazil.2.a: "We have our work cut out for us."
 Brazil.3.t: "The Repatriation of Brazilian Citizens in Wuhan"
 Brazil.3.d: "With the reports of a novel coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan comes the question of what to do with the Brazilian nationals that happen to find themselves stranded right in the epicenter of the outbreak. The Brazilian Air Force has charted a plan to repatriate the Brazilian citizens, who will be tested for the disease and put in quarantine for 18 upon arrival on national soil. However, with the infection and death toll in China rapidly spreading and commercial airlines around the world beginning to cancel flights, the concern of this repatriation potentially speeding up the spread of the coronavirus to Brazil has been raised."
 Brazil.3.a: "Our thoughts and prayers shall be with them."
 Brazil.3.b: "Send in the airforce! Nobody left behind!"
 Brazil.4.t: "The Political Tit-for-Tat"
 Brazil.4.d: "Brazilian politics, like every other republic under the sun, is a game of give and take. However, the legislative branch in particular is very keen on the taking part. Since it is rare that a majority of senators and deputies can ever reasonably agree on something, the Brazilian political process seems to be in a perpetual state of deadlock - that is, until someone can come in and grease the wheels.This was a problem for Bolsonaro, who built his campaign under promises of fighting PT's corruption only to find itself needing to engage into the same practices to get anything done.\n\nPart of him felt tempted to just give into this status quo, let the legislative have its way while he sat comfortably in power - after all, they were not ones to bite the hand that would feed them. But doing so would mean betraying his ideals and the promises he had made to the Brazilian people. There had to be another way, a way to keep this political rabble in line and get them to sing to his tune.\n\nPerhaps it was time to get self-interest out of government, and replace it with a cohesive ideology."
 Brazil.4.a: "Turns out, being a president is hard work."
 Brazil.5.t: "Reshuffling the Cabinet"
 Brazil.5.d: "While Dilma's impeachment in 2016 succeeded in removing the Worker's Party from power, it also had the side effect of flexing the muscles of the legislative branch. As a result, we have had to contend with an emboldened chamber and senate dominated by a centrist coalition that will stop at nothing to get their way. We cannot do anything about these institutions, at least not without treading over the constitution, but that doesn't mean we are without options.\n\nThe executive has the final say in the president's cabinet. Traditionally, ministerial seats are negotiated with the parties of the legislative in exchange for support, but in doing so we risk opening our flanks to their interests. Jair Bolsonaro had other plans for these positions - to fill them with reliable, loyal and ideologically-aligned names and fortify the executive branch against attacks from the legislative. The president has elected several military officers for these positions as well, furthering the alliance between the current administration and the Brazilian Army."
 Brazil.5.a: "Can't go wrong with a military cabinet!"
 Brazil.6.t: "Discharging the Federal Police Director"
 Brazil.6.d: "Federal Police General-Director Maurício Leite Valeixo has been exonerated from his position today, under a \"request\" according to a decree signed by president Jair Bolsonaro and Justice Minister Sérgio Moro. Moro, however, has been caught by surprise by the exoneration, denying signage of the dismissal request.\n\nBolsonaro has yet to make a comment on the exoneration, but previous reports have suggested a desire of the president to replace the Federal Police Director with someone closer to himself. Opposition members have pointed out several open investigation probes into names close to Bolsonaro harkening back to Operation Car Wash, which could have been a reason for the president to tighten his grip on the Federal Police."
 Brazil.6.a: "Swap him! And if you can't, swap his chief!"
 Brazil.7.t: "Justice Minister Sérgio Moro Quits!"
 Brazil.7.d: "Bolsonaro's Justice Minister and former Operation Car Wash judge Sérgio Moro has confirmed his detachment from the government today, being the ninth minister to quit their position in Bolsonaro's government so far. Moro's decision was motivated by the recent exoneration of the former Federal Police Director, who had been indicated to the position by the now ex-minister. Moro claims to have been surprised by the announcement of the dismissal, that no specific motive was given, and that Bolsonaro has admitted that the decision is political interference since the president intended on having a director that would give him priviledged information on ongoing investigations and inquiries in the Supreme Court."
 Brazil.7.a: "Turns out, the \"Carte Blanche\" was a ruse."
 Brazil.8.t: "Bolsonaro Breaks Quarantine to Rally Up Base"
 Brazil.8.d: "Against WHO guidelines, president Jair Bolsonaro held a rally today in front of the Brazilian Army HQ to dozens of his supporters. In the event, the president issued speeches from atop a pickup truck defending a military intervention and criticizing the methods of the \"old politics\". The crowd could be heard chanting slogans such as \"out with Maia\", \"close congress\", \"close the supreme court\" and clamoring for the return of the \"AI-5\", the fifth institutional act signed in 1968 that suspended several constitutional rights and solidified the military dictatorship in Brazil at the time.\n\nCritics of Bolsonaro have not only pointed out the healthcare hazards of holding a significant rally during an ongoing pandemic with the president even having openly coughed over the crowd several times, but they have also brought up the blatant inconstitutional nature of the speeches and chants, which called for illegal acts against the Brazilian republican establishment. While it seems that the rally had a boosting effect on the president's approval ratings, it also boosted explicit disapproval and worsened polarization in the Brazilian people as well."
 Brazil.8.a: "At least he didn't shake hands with anyone?"
 Brazil.9.t: "Discussing Government Positions With The Centrão"
 Brazil.9.d: "The administration has been discussing some key positions with senator Ciro Nogueira and federal deputy Arthur Lira from the Progressive Party in exchange of support to Jair Bolsonaro. Presidents and leaders from PP, Republicanos and PL have been present in at least a dozen recent meetings in the Palácio do Planalto, among those of other parties. The so-called \"Centrão\" has participated in the cabinets of previous governments, such as Dilma Rousseff's and Michael Temer's, often in exchange for political support.\n\nMost recently, Fernando Marcondes de Araújo Leão has been selected to direct the DNOCS, a department of works to counter droughts such as irrigation and reservoir projects. Fernando's name had been suggested by centrist leaders. The government already has several other seats lined up for Centrão names, suggesting that Jair Bolsonaro might have opted to follow a more moderate and standard approach to politics by making concessions to the legislative's majority blocs. Whether this means an abandonment of his radical beliefs or not remains to be seen."
 Brazil.9.a: "Centrão above all?"
 Brazil.10.t: "Centrist in Charge of Government"
 Brazil.10.d: "Deputy Ricardo Barros from PP-RR has stated last afternoon in his personal social media account that he is to be nominated the new leader of Jair Bolsonaro's government in the Chamber of Deputies, replacing current leader Vitor Hugo. In the post, Ricardo Barros thanked the president for his \"trust in the invitation\". Ricardo Barros had previously been a health minister under Michael Temer and left the position to run in the 2018 elections for federal deputy.\n\nThis development marks another step in Bolsonaro's move towards the Centrão for the last few months, with the concession of this leadership position consolidating this proximity. While this alliance allows the government to have the support it needs in the Chamber to pass law projects in their interest and avoid \"loaded projects\" from the opposition, it comes with a loss of autonomy of the executive's cabinet, as centrist-aligned politicians get nominated for ministerial and leadership positions.\n\nWhile Bolsonaro has been able to maintain a significant portion of the Brazilian population rallied to his reactionary ideals, many of the president's supporters have been skeptical about the news, believing that the administration has \"finally sold out to the Centrão\"."
 Brazil.10.a: "The Centrão always wins."
 Brazil.11.t: "First Covid-19 Cases Diagnosed in Brazil"
 Brazil.11.d: "The Health Ministry has confirmed the first case of the novel coronavirus infection in Brasil, a 61 year old man living in São Paulo recently arrived from a trip to Italy. This marks not only the first case in Brazil, but also all of Latin America. According to health minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta, the patient arrived to the country without symptoms and sought health services a few days later with respiratory symptoms. 30 other people that have been in contact with him have also been put under observation. Other passengers of Air France flight AF 454 will not be quarantined, but those that were in close proximity to the patient will also be put under observation.\n\nMandetta has advised that those with symptoms should avoid travelling for the time being, and inform authorities upon arrival if symptoms arise. Besides this case, at least 20 other patients in the country are currently under investigation for the coronavirus infection."
 Brazil.11.a: "Everything will be under control."
 Brazil.12.t: "Bolsonaro Acknowledges Covid-19 Outbreak"
 Brazil.12.d: "With Covid-19 cases rapidly spreading throughout the country and even several cases resulting in deaths, president Jair Bolsonaro has finally acknowledged the outbreak in his most recent statement. However, to the despair of healthcare workers and his own health ministry, Bolsonaro has criticized requests for self-isolation and early quarantine measures, calling it a \"fearmongering media campaign\" and referring to the disease as \"nothing more than a little flu\". Bolsonaro also boasted about his alleged \"athlete background\" protecting him from the worst symptoms should he get infected.\n\nThe president's stance has led to discussions behind closed doors with the health minister Henrique Mandetta, who called for lockdowns to contain the spread. It seems that Bolsonaro's plans have no room for Covid-19 measures, but perhaps some actions could be taken under the table..."
 Brazil.12.a: "But it won't get that bad, right?"
 Brazil.13.t: "Emergency Covid Welfare Fund"
 Brazil.13.d: "President Jair Bolsonaro has sanctioned today a law establishing a monthly emergency fund of R$$ 600 for three months to informal workers. The goal of this fund is to dampen the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the income of such workers, who lack the protections of formalized employment. The fund is expected to benefit 54 million Brazilians. Although Bolsonaro has already signed the law, he will be withhelding its publication so long as provisions are taken to indicate the credit source of the fund, which is estimated to cost around R$ 100 billion."
 Brazil.13.a: "It's not much, but every little bit counts."
 Brazil.14.t: "Extending the Emergency Covid Welfare Fund"
 Brazil.14.d: "The emergency Covid-19 fund sanctioned 3 months ago has proven to be a lifeline for many Brazilians under precarious employment conditions, as the Covid-19 pandemic has directly impacted their income. The initially established duration for the fund is nearing its end, but with the pandemic showing no signs of letting down anytime soon, talks of extending it are being had. While extending the fund would mean further relief to the Brazilian working class and potentially higher ratings for the administration, it would also mean going way beyond the budget that had been initially agreed upon for the fund. Bolsonaro has offered a compromise solution of cutting the fund by half for the extension, from R$$ 600 to 300 monthly. Ultimately, it is up to him to sanction or veto the extension."
 Brazil.14.a: "The Brazilian people need every penny."
 Brazil.14.b: "The current value is too high for the country."
 Brazil.14.c: "We're about done handing out freebies."
 Brazil.15.t: "Dealing With Henrique Mandetta"
 Brazil.15.d: "With the rifts between president Jair Bolsonaro and his health minister Henrique Mandetta becoming more evident every day, it was all but inevitable that the two would eventually fall off. Mandetta has been defending social distancing as the most effective manner of combatting the Covid-19 pandemic, as per WHO guidelines, while Bolsonaro has ignored these recommendations repeatedly and went on frequent rides around Brasília, often mingling with supporters during rallies.\n\nAs the country's death tool reaches the thousands, the president has opted to fire the health minister. The next name lined up for the position is oncologist Nelson Teich. In a statement, Bolsonaro has stated that he \"puts the lives of the Brazilian people above everything else\" and argued that every country in the world has its specificities when it comes to dealing with the pandemic. Bolsonaro stated that Mandetta had overtly prioritized social isolation and not given attention to his own concerns regarding the economy. Finally, the president criticized isolation as a measure against the disease."
 Brazil.15.a: "It was a consensual divorce."
 Brazil.16.t: "The Oil Crisis Hits Brazil!"
 Brazil.16.d: "Brazilians have woken up to skyrocketing fuel prices and gigantic lines at gas stations today, as the effects of the Saudi collapse are felt in the country. With around 20% of the country's fuel imports coming from Saudi Arabia, and another 15% from the US, a third of the nation's gas sources have been compromised, leading to shortages across the country.\n\nWhile Brazil does extract enough oil to be considered self-sufficient, it lacks the oil refining capabilities to make use of these reserves, relying on imports to maintain its fuel reserves. While the international situation has boosted our gains from exports, they have been completely offset by these import costs, leaving us at a net loss.\n\nAnalysts warn that the fuel shortages could lead to further political instability in the country."
 Brazil.16.a: "Let's hope they have some extra reserves at Petrobrás..."
 Brazil.17.t: "Brazilian Covid Cases Skyrocket"
 Brazil.17.d: "We can't control it anymore."
 Brazil.17.a: "It is our problem as well now."
 Brazil.18.t: "Senator Calls For Parliamentary Inquiry Into Covid-19"
 Brazil.18.d: "Actions have consequences..."
 Brazil.18.a: "Just the opposition kicking up a stir."
 Brazil.19.t: "Covid Parliamentary Inquiry Commitee Installed"
 Brazil.19.d: "Huh this is really happening."
 Brazil.19.a: "Can't we have a break? I'm trying to govern here!"
 Brazil.20.t: "The Brazilian Chamber of Deputies"
 Brazil.20.d: "Every president in the Sixth Brazilian Republic, be it left, right or center, must deal with the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, where the elected representatives of the Brazilian people gather to discuss and vote on projects. This is no different for Jair Bolsonaro: while his coalition and allies have managed to secure a sizable portion of the chamber in the 2018 elections, it still hasn't been enough to secure a majority, as it has ever been for any president.\n\nAs we cannot rely solely on our allies, we have to engage with the neutral factions in the chamber: the centrists, or \"Centrão\" as they've come to be called. With some well-placed persuasion, we can secure their support for our causes, however we must also be careful about not letting their influence get too high to the point they can obstruct our policies.\n\nIn the long term, our goal should be to grow our own coalition in the chamber by increasing support for our own ideologies in the Brazilian people in time for future elections. Having a larger allied coalition would reduce our dependency on the Centrão, and potentially enable us total dominance of the chamber."
 Brazil.20.a: "Unfortunately, we must partake in their political games."
 Brazil.21.t: "The Amazonian Jungle"
 Brazil.21.d: "Our North is covered by the world's largest jungle, the Amazonian Jungle. Nicknamed the \"Lungs of The World\", this massive green tapestry sees the equivalent of over two thousand soccer fields slashed and burned every day for logging, mining and agricultural activities, which have ramped up under Bolsonaro's presidency.\n\nWhile devastating it is a necessary evil in order to expand the economic activities our country relies in the most, the consequences of letting this process get out of control are also significant, not only in the climate impact but also in political capital.\n\nIn the short term, we should do what we can to counteract the rampant slashing and burning of the jungle. In the long term, we might be able to enact stronger reforms that will reduce or potentially even reverse the trend, albeit we should expect strong resistance from many lobbying groups against it."
 Brazil.21.a: "All this bother over some trees..."
 Brazil.22.t: "Lula da Silva Back In The Race?"
 Brazil.22.d: "With the overturning of Lula da Silva's convictions by Federal Supreme Court minister Edson Fachin, not only has Lula's release from prison been solidified, but he also has regained his political rights, being allowed to run for president again. Brazil's constitutional term limits only apply to consecutive terms, so the ex-president would be allowed to run for a third term in 2022 against incumbent Jair Bolsonaro. Lula originally planned to run in 2018 after Dilma's second term and impeachment, but his now overturned convictions accrued during the Car Wash Trials led to his imprisonment and inability to run, enabling for the rise of the current administration.\n\nThe news have highly polarized the country, with PT supporters and the left in general rejoicing and claiming that \"justice had been made\", as well as showing eager support for Lula in the 2022 elections, should he decide to run again. Bolsonaro supporters have strongly denounced Fachin's decision however, claiming that Lula is still a convicted criminal and should have never been let out of prison, let alone have his political rights restored.\n\nFor Bolsonaro's government, this moment has been a wake-up call, as the expected easy road to 2022 without any real opposition is no longer a reality and it has become very likely that Bolsonaro will have to run against a very strong political powerhouse."
 Brazil.22.a: "This is looking to be an interesting election."
 Brazil.23.t: "Shifting our Focus Towards The Supreme Court"
 Brazil.23.d: "Xandão tá te vendo usando cheats pra passar à frente"
 Brazil.23.a: "Vossa Excelência provoca em mim os instintos mais primitivos."
 Brazil.24.t: "Trump Victorious in The US Elections!"
 Brazil.24.d: "Trump's re-election is not only being celebrated by Republican voters in the US, but also by Bolsonaro's own voting base as well as the Brazilian president himself. Almost immediately after the results were confirmed, Bolsonaro called Trump in order to congratulate him on his victory. The Brazilian president is expected to attend the inauguration next January with his family.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro has also taken the opportunity to talk directly to his followers in one of his presidential streams, affirming that Trump's election is proof that traditional values and hard work are what makes a country great, and that he expects great co-operation between the two nations in the near future. The president then ended the stream on a note of ensuring that, just as Trump's project for the US was given the chance to continue, so should his project for Brazil."
 Brazil.24.a: "The Americans have made the right choice. Here's hoping the Brazilians do so too."
 Brazil.25.t: "Biden Victorious in The US Elections!"
 Brazil.25.d: "While all across Brazil, the left is celebrating Biden's triumph against Trump in the recent US elections, the mood is somber in the Palácio do Planato. Bolsonaro had put a lot of his political credit behind Trump's campaign hoping it would pay off in the near future, and yet his candidate, the one representing all he had been fighting for, had lost.\n\nIt was said that whatever happens in American politics soon follows in Brazil, and Bolsonaro was very much aware of the opposition to his administration growing stronger. But this was no time to dwell on it. There was much to learn from the failures of Trump's campaign. And in the worst case scenario, he had a contingency plan to fall back on.\n\nBolsonaro wondered if it would be wise to phone Biden and congratulate him on his victory, as was tradition, but he decided against it. It would only rally up his political rivals more and seem like an admittal of defeat."
 Brazil.25.a: "No comment."
 Brazil.26.t: "Formation of The \"Brazilian Popular Front\""
 Brazil.26.d: "It seems that the Brazilian far-right are not the only extremists rallying up for the upcoming elections. Calling itself the \"Brazilian Popular Front\", the newly-announced far-left coalition claims to unite the multiple communist and radical socialist parties across the country, including members of PSOL, PCB, PCR, PCdoB and even the black sheep of the movement, PCO.\n\nThe initiative came from Popular Unity, a self-proclaimed revolutionary socialist party. UP president Léo Péricles formalized the coalition today, describing it as a \"response to the regime of death wrought by Bolsonaro and his allies\" and promising a \"real, tangible socialist plan for the nation\".\n\nWhile the Brazilian left seems to have rejoiced in this unexpected display of political unity, others have scoffed at the display, calling it an \"union of midget parties\" and dismissing it as a relevant political force. Still, many point out to this act as yet another sign of Brazil's rising political radicalization and division."
 Brazil.26.a: "Unity between leftists? Crazy world."
 Brazil.27.t: "Lula da Silva Announces Presidential Campaign"
 Brazil.27.d: "The Worker's Party has formally announced the pre-campaign of ex-president Luís Inácio Lula da Silva for presidency in the 2022 elections. The announcement was made at a convention center in the Northern Zone of São Paulo last Saturday. Currently, Lula's campaign has the support of five parties - PCdoB, PSOL, Rede, Solidariedade and PV. The VP position is still being debated. According to insiders, former São Paulo state governor Geraldo Alckmin had been approached with an invitation for the position and a proposal for a \"broad coalition\", but the initiative saw little support from both Lula and Alckmin.\n\nThe current government has yet to comment on this announcement, but a change in gears has been experienced in the Palácio do Planalto, where allegedly a new 2022 campaign strategy is being prepared for PL and Jair Bolsonaro's re-election. The current president's reputation has taken a hit following the Covid-19 pandemic and Saudi Oil Crisis, but the president's staff seems optmistic in a campaign against Lula in 2022."
 Brazil.27.a: "But would the Brazilian people want him back?"
 Brazil.28.t: "Popular Front Backs Lula da Silva"
 Brazil.28.d: "Brazilian Popular Front leader Léo Péricles has announced today their support for presidential candidate Lula da Silva in the upcoming elections. Péricles has stated that \"revolutionary belief should not override pragmatism\", and that the coalition is confident Lula can be trusted to carry out a socialist project for the country, within the capabilities afforded to him as president of Brazil.\n\nThe decision came at no surprise to the majority of Brazilians, albeit it has been met with some backlash from the more radical left who expected the Popular Front to run against PT, at least initially. Many analysts and online commenters have pointed out the fact that the Popular Front lacks the strength to compete against any of the candidates as an untold reasoning for the decision.\n\nWhile this seems to be a bucket of cold water on the revolutionaries' hopes, the coalition has reaffirmed its commitment to radical socialist and communist ideals regardless of the outcome of the elections, and has warned Lula that \"our support comes with demands\". Lula's campaign has yet to respond to this development."
 Brazil.28.a: "Pragmatism wins again."
 Brazil.29.t: "The Covid-19 Parliamentary Inquiry Comission"
 Brazil.29.d: "Covid trials begin"
 Brazil.29.a: "Let's all hope for a fair trial."
 Brazil.30.t: "Hearing on The Firing of Health Ministers"
 Brazil.30.d: "The first major hearing of the Covid Trials has been on Henrique Mandetta, former health minister in Bolsonaro's government. In early 2020, as the first Covid-19 cases began to spread in Brazil, Mandetta claims to have advised Jair Bolsonaro on which measures to take agains the incoming pandemic, such as issuing mask mandates and lockdown orders. The president would have refused to listen to the minister's advice, and after continued pressure from Mandetta, eventually decided to fire the health minister and replace him with a less confrontational name. Mandetta's replacement Nelson Teich was also later fired for the same cause, and the successor Pazuello was then fired recently due to pressures from centrists, having been replaced by the current Marcelo Queiroga.\n\nTo the audience, this high turnover rate in the health ministry indicates a clear intent of the administration to prioritizing ideology over the safety of the population as the pandemic numbers rose in the country, which does not bode well for the president Jair Bolsonaro."
 Brazil.30.a: "Mandetta's hands are clean!"
 Brazil.31.t: "Hearing on The Health Ministry's Role"
 Brazil.31.d: "The first major hearing of the Covid Trials has been on Henrique Mandetta, Bolsonaro's current health minister. In early 2020, as the first Covid-19 cases began to spread in Brazil, Mandetta claims to have advised Jair Bolsonaro on which measures to take agains the incoming pandemic, such as issuing mask mandates and lockdown orders. He then claims that, while the president had been reluctant to follow his advice at first, he would eventually concede after repeated pressure from the health ministry, implementing some regulations that would be key in preventing a complete Covid-19 disaster scenario in the country.\n\nWhen asked about Bolsonaro's controversial statements on the pandemic, the health minister admitted that they might have had a negative impact on the development of the virus in the country, but argues that the president's positive actions have outweighed the negatives. While this is not being seen as an absolution of Bolsonaro, it at least does paint a picture of the president ultimately putting the safety of Brazilians above his own thoughts on the pandemic."
 Brazil.31.a: "Actions, not words."
 Brazil.32.t: "Bolsonaro Accused of Conspiracy!"
 Brazil.32.d: "The latest hearing of the Covid Trials has admittedly veered slightly off-topic, as it has focused on Bolsonaro's political maneuvers rather than his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. A coalition of opposition and centrist deputies has put forward an accusation of conspiracy directed towards Bolsonaro and his cabinet. According to the document, the president would have been attempting to undermine the legislative branch by refusing to negotiate and instead opting to fill his government with names picked by ideology, not merit.\n\nThe opposition has taken these accusations further, suggesting that this move on Bolsonaro's part was an attempt to set up his cabinet for a \"Self Coup\" which would have seen the closure of the legislative and judiciary branches and a rule by decree scenario. While the latter accusations have been shelved for now, the former have been put under analysis, indicating a potential rift between Bolsonaro's administration and the other branches of government."
 Brazil.32.a: "Such investigations would be beyond the scope of this inquiry."
 Brazil.33.t: "Parliamentarians Testify in Favor of Bolsonaro."

 Brazil.40.t: "The 2022 Elections Race Is On!"
 Brazil.40.d: "With Covid-19 and the Oil Crisis finally being addressed by the Brazilian government, the nation has been finally able to shift its focus towards the 2022 election campaigns. Political ads are already beginning to run on public TV channels at their alloted time, social media posts are ramping up, and how could we forget the never-ending barrage of \"santinhos\" being distributed at every street corner?\n\nWhile it all seems familiar on the surface, it's also very obvious that this year's elections are nothing like any other in Brazil's history. The nations has never been this polarized between the two main candidates, political radicalization is at an all time high with fringe groups coming out of the woodworks, and the ongoing political crisis in the USA has cast a concerning shadow over all of Latin America. To many, these elections aren't just a matter of who gets to lead the country over the next four years, but whether there'll still be a country left to lead."
 Brazil.40.a: "Get on the campaign trail!"
 Brazil.41.t: "Choosing Our Candidate"
 Brazil.41.d: "In Brazil's most divisive elections yet, it all has come down to three major candidates for the presidential seat. On the right, we have the incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, seeking the continuation of his national project for the country. Rising to power after growing discontent with PT led to the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff and imprisonment of Lula, he's had a relaxed path to winning the 2018 elections. But with the baggage of the last two years of crisis piling up and the grand return of his arch-nemesis to the political front, it seems that Bolsonaro's campaign staff will be working overtime this time around.\n\nOn the left, Lula da Silva has returned with a vengeance after being barred from running in 2018 due to his imprisonment. The convictions now lifted and the Brazilians having experienced hardship after hardship under Bolsonaro, it seems that the progressives have a direct shot at retaking power, provided they don't drop the ball in the final stretch.\n\nFinally, the center is running Geraldo Alckmin on a platform of rejecting polarization and extremism and instead returning Brazil to normalcy. While the center dominates the legislative, it hasn't been in control of the executive since 2002. A centrist administration would consolidate their control over the Brazilian establishment, but selling Alckmin and PSDB to a heavily polarized population has proven to be easier said than done.\n\nBe it left, right or center, everyone can at least agree on one thing: Whoever wins this year's elections will dictate the shape of Brazilian politics for the upcoming decade. So, who will we be supporting?"
 Brazil.41.a: "Lula da Silva, the Worker's Party candidate!"

 Brazil.43.t: "Bolsonaro's Replacement Candidate"
 Brazil.43.d: "With Jair Bolsonaro's reputation heavily tarnished post Covid Trials, president of the Liberal Party Valdemar Costa Neto has brought up the possibility of his replacement by one of his offspring. Bolsonaro's three oldest sons are heavily involved in politics and even hold positions of their own, with Flávio holding the position of senator, Eduardo being a federal deputy and Carlos a city councilman. All three have shown a commitment to Jair Bolsonaro's national project and ideology, and the plan was sold to Jair as a respite for the captain to retreat and recover while one of the three takes over matters in the meantime, enabling for his grand return further down the line.\n\nWhile Valdemar Costa Neto has argued that the Bolsonaro family name carries enough weight to justify this replacement, Jair has shown some reluctancy, worrying that doing so could kill the momentum of his campaign. Bolsonaro also expressed a concern that his sons could end up conspiring against him in the future if they were allowed to get elected in his place. With the pressure of the election day building up, a decision had to be made quick before campaigning could proceed:"
 Brazil.43.a: "Zero-one, Flavio, is the obvious pick."
 Brazil.43.b: "Zero-two, Carlos, he deserves a chance."

 Brazil.56.t: "Brazilian Response to The Second American Civil War"
 Brazil.56.d: "With the complete breakdown of the United States into conflict, it was inevitable that Brazil would experience severe aftershocks. While there has been an expectation for the political establishment to immediately pick sides between the Biden and Trump administrations, the consensus across the board seems to be that Brazil should maintain a position of neutrality for the time being, lest we risk angering the wrong side in the conflict. That is not to say that preferences haven't been made obvious, however: Jair Bolsonaro and his reactionary supporters have always had a sympathy for Donald Trump's rethoric, while Lula da Silva and the progressive wing would be more aligned with Biden's policies.\n\nThings are more cut and dry at the fringes of Brazilian politics, however. The Brazilian Popular Front has pointed to this conflict as the inevitable outcome of a capitalist system in crisis and has expressed support for the numerous radical leftist uprisings in the country. On the other hand, far-right movements like the Brazilian Integralist Front have blamed this outcome on an alleged continued degradation of American patriotic, religious and family values, which they claim are the pillars of a healthy society. The integralists have shown support for the Patriot Front under Thomas Rousseau, but have thus far refused to endorse or denounce the more explicit national-socialist insurrections in the US.\n\nMany political analysts have shown concern for the complete breakdown of US society having a domino effect across the Americas, if not the entire world. With Brazilian society in a similar state of instability and polarization as seen in the US in the months prior to the 2020 elections and the civil war, they have raised concerns of a similar fate befalling our nation, should the results of the upcoming 2022 elections not get accepted by a significant part of the population."
 Brazil.56.a: "It couldn't happen here, right?"
 Brazil.57.t: "Brazilian Civil War Refugees Return to The Country"
 Brazil.57.d: "As the internal conflicts in the US continue to escalate, many Brazilian citizens living in the country have been escaping the chaos and returning to Brazil. The state of Florida in particular has been home to a large contingent of Brazilian immigrants in the US, who have been fleeing the state en masse due to the presence of the Atomwaffen Division, which has been reported to be rounding up anyone not deemed \"Aryan enough\" in their views.\n\nWhile many were able to embark on the last commercial flights out of the country before US airports were closed, others have fled by sea or crossing into Mexico, which has been cause of concern for a refugee crisis taking place in Central America and further destabilizing these states. Nevertheless, the Brazilian government and air force has been working tiredlessly to repatriate Brazilian citizens still stuck in the US or Central America, but it has warned that the window before doing so becomes too risky is closing fast."
 Brazil.57.a: "Welcome back."
 Brazil.58.t: "Civil War Breaks Out in Colombia!"
 Brazil.58.d: "The instability wrought by the Second American Civil War seems to have finally reached our half of the continent, as large-scale armed confrontation has broke out in Colombia following a military coup against Gustavo Petro. The mood at Itamaraty has been frantic as diplomats and other foreign affairs workers have shown a lack of preparedness in how to handle with a conflict of such proportions at Brazil's doorsteps. Should we interviene? Or restrict ourselves to sending foreign aid? Offer asylum to Petro? Wait for the conflict to wind down?\n\nMany are also concerned about the integrity of Brazil's own government, as the same ideological divisions, political radicalization and crumbling establishments that led to the conflicts in the US and Colombia are present in Brazil. Right now, the consensus seems to be that we must ensure we can get through our own elections and avoid a similar fate before considering any sort of aid or intervention."
 Brazil.58.a: "The fires have reached South America..."
 Brazil.59.t: "Far-Right Militants Protest Lula's Election"
 Brazil.59.d: "Thousands of protesters have gathered today to protest Lula da Silva's victory in the 2022 elections in major cities across the country. The protesters, dressed in the green and yellow tones of the Brazilian flag, have gathered around local military headquarters asking for military intervention against the election results. The protesters claim that the elections have been tampered with, that Lula is a communist agent seeking to destroy the country, and that the army should rise up and defend the nation as it is their sworn duty.\n\nJair Bolsonaro, who the protesters claim to be the legitimate next elected president of Brasil, has so far neither conceded nor denied his defeat in the elections. He has addressed the protests, stating their cause to be valid and demanding that they remain peaceful. Members of the military high command have yet to comment on the nature of these protests."

 Brazil.61.d: "Thousands of Popular Front protesters have gathered today to protest Bolsonaro's victory in the 2022 elections in major cities across the country. The protesters, dressed in mostly red and black which are the colors associated with the far-left movement, have taken to the streets demanding investigations on alleged voter manipulation and suppression tactics used by Bolsonaro's campaign in the elections. Leaders of the protests have claimed that Bolsonaro's campaign would have illegally influenced the results by employing methods such as having employers enforce votes, directly buying votes in smaller towns and making use of the highway police to hamper movement in areas known to vote for the Worker's Party. While Bolsonaro's campaign has raised eyebrows in the Electoral Justice before, they have claimed that the elections have been \"within the acceptable parameters of fairness\" and that there is no warrant for further investigations for the time being.\nLula da Silva, whom the Popular Front claim to be the actual winner of the election, has yet to comment on the development. Other Worker's Party politicians have shown conflicting opinions on the protests, with some denouncing them as anti-democratic while others have shown support for their cause. The current administration has claimed to be watching these developments closely."

 Brazil.62.t: "Election Protests Wind Down"
 Brazil.62.d: "Brazilians can finally breathe a sigh of relief, as the radical protests against the 2022 election results seem to be finally dying down. Protester numbers have dwindled in the past few days, and the claims made by the protesters seem to have been greatly scaled back from previous statements. The perceived polarization of the Brazilian society for the last two years and the massive shock of the US civil war have led many analysts to assume that these protests could escalate into a similar conflict, however it's seeming more and more that the gravity of the situation has been overstated and that the Brazilians are just not as radicalized as initially thought. As more protesters are coming to terms with their new reality and heading home, it seems that unlike what happened in the United States between Trump and Biden, Brazil is on the path to a peaceful transition of power."
 Brazil.62.a: "Nothing ever happens."
 Brazil.63.t: "Bolsonaro Supporters Camp Around Military Bases"
 Brazil.63.d: "The ongoing protests by Bolsonaro supporters have escalated to a new level, as the self-denominated \"Brazilian Patriots\" have set up encampments around military bases across the country, with some remaining on site around the clock. A Federal Police operation has been ordered by Federal Supreme Court minister Alexandre de Moraes, but thus far it seems to have failed to break down the protests and only led to their further galvanization. The number of protesters also have increased over the past few days, with recruitment taking place in Telegram and WhatsApp groups.\n\nWhile many of these encampments are relatively simple, some of the biggest ones feature a surprising amount of facilities, such as porta-potties, improvised kitchens and speaker trucks. Members of the encampment have been spending their time in activities such as singing the national anthem, grilling barbecues and chatting while not actively protesting."
 Brazil.63.a: "Don't these people have jobs?"
 Brazil.63.b: "72 more hours, and the fraud shall be revealed!"
 Brazil.64.t: "Far-Right Militants Blockade Highways"
 Brazil.64.d: "The election protests have spread out of military bases and onto federal and state highways, as encampments have been set up besides major roadways and the pro-military protesters have taken to blockading through traffic. This development appears to have been spearheaded by a reactionary contingent of truckers who have used their vehicles to form barricades and direct traffic to improvised checkpoints all around the country. Drivers have reported being stuck in traffic for dozens of hours at a time, and those that managed to cross the blockades report that protesters have been performing ideological checks on the occupants of vehicles in exchange for letting them through. Drivers have even been advised to remove any stickers from their vehicles that could represent an opposing political view to that of the protests, with reports of vehicles being linched.\n\nSome drivers have began to fight back, in particular truckers who are not aligned with the protests have on occasion forced their way through blockades, often being chased by the protesters as a result. Consumers are also being impacted by the blockades, with massive delays in the transportation of products resulting in gaps in supply chains across the nation.
 Brazil.64.a: "They are no longer protesters, they're criminals!"
 Brazil.64.b: "They're doing what needs to be done to save this country."
 Brazil.65.t: "Bomb Threat Discovered at Brasília International Airport!"
 Brazil.65.d: "The Distrito Federal Military Police have discovered an explosive artifact on a truck parked around the Brasília International Airport yesterday. The artifact was reported by the driver of a fuel truck, who noticed the strange object in the truck and contacted the police. The driver claimed he did not know who could have placed the device on the truck, and the police have discarded the possibility of his involvement in the case. The Military Police have transported the explosive device to a remote location where it will be safely detonated.\n\nThe main suspect behind the attempt is Bolsonaro supporter George Washington, 54, who has confessed to arming the explosive with the intetion to \"sow chaos\" and lead to the declaration of a state of siege in the country, under which public rights and the power of the legislative and judiciary are restricted. According to the suspect, the plan had been made at a military base encampment, leading the police to initiate an investigation for other potential collaborators. Washington has also pointed to similar plans to bomb the Brazilian power grid and cause blackouts to the same effect.\nAirport activity has been not affected by the ocurrence."
 Brazil.65.a: "There's no political agreement and no amnesty for terrorists!"
 Brazil.65.b: "Nothing justifies a terrorist attempt. We must fight, but we must be smart!"
 Brazil.66.t: "Terrorist Attack in Brasília International Airport!"
 Brazil.66.d: "Disaster struck today as an explosive has been detonated at the Brasília International Airport. The explosion appears to have originated from a fuel truck that was parked near the North Wing of the main terminal, between gates 12 and 21, leading to the complete destruction of the connecting corridor and Western side of the sub-building. An airliner docked at gate 21 was also completely incinerated. The explosion caused fires in the North and Central wings of the terminal, which have been put out after 21 grueling hours of work by the CBMDF.\n\nRescue operations are currently still underway, but it is estimated that the death toll is at least four hundred, with potentially a thousand wounded. The driver of the truck was found still in the vehicle, carbonized, and the police are still investigating the possibility of whether he was an accessory to the event or not. Eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mysterious man approach the truck hours before the event. The police has yet to make any arrests.\nThis event marks the most devastating single terrorist attack on Brazilian soil and the second time a bomb has been detonated at an airport within the country. Reactions across the spectrum have been of shock and horror, with many seeing parallels to similar bombing attacks that have been happening in the US in the moments leading to the ongoing conflict. As the pro-Bolsonaro protests continue to sow chaos in the country, many have pointed to them as the potential breeding ground for this event, and calls to crack down on the encampments have resonated in the progressive wing, while conservatives have disavowed the attacks and claimed them to be false flags."

 Brazil.67.t: "Power Grid Attacked by Insurgents"
 Brazil.67.d: "Seems that the country's descent into chaos is nowhere near over. After the recent bombing of the Brasília Airport, new attacks have been reporting on the power grid in central areas of Brazil. The attackers have detonated explosives around power lines and substations, effectively severing the nation's power grid in half and causing rolling intermitent blackous even in areas over a thousand kilometers away from the attacks. The consequences have been catastrophic, with the power failures having impacts on many businesses and public services across the country.\n\nThe attacks seem to have been meticulously coordinated - a total of 8 strike points were identified thus far, with all happening within 5 hours of one another. While some of the terrorists are still at large, some of the attackers were captured by the Military Police before they were able to escape and are currently being held in custody. The authorities have so far refused to share any information about the suspects and their motivations to the press, but many have pointed at the ongoing election protests as an obvious source of the attacks."

 Brazil.74.t: "Retaking The Federal District"
 Brazil.74.d: "With the Federal District overran by the anti-democratic protesters, it has become clear to Lula and his allies that it is too dangerous to return to the capital. Attempts to hold the fort against the insurrection have failed, with many reporting that the military even gave way to them in some cases. Governmental buildings are being occupied, looted and vandalized, the outside areas around the Plaza of the Three Powers are chaotic and packed with protesters not letting anyone in, even the press or the police. Something must be done if we want to get this country back on track.\n\nThe president has been discussing with the military high command the possibility of enacting a GLO - Guarantee of Law and Order - which would allow the military to effectively act as a police force temporarily, in this case to retake the Federal District and arrest the vandals where the Federal Police has failed to do so. The army has shown willingness to cooperate with the government and endorsed the GLO as a solution to this problem.\n\nHowever, not everyone is on board with the idea. First lady Rosângela Lula da Silva has repeatedly expressed her concerns with the idea, urging the president to \"not accept the GLO, because it is everything they are wishing for\". According to the first lady, the military would be planning to use the powers granted by the GLO in order to coup Lula's administration, and she has argued that the president should instead enact a federal intervention as per article 34 of the constitution, which would allow the appointment of an interventor in the Federal District to more closely command the Federal Police forces against the invaders."
 Brazil.74.a: "Janja's right, a GLO would mean a coup. We'll enact a federal intervention instead."
 Brazil.74.b: "This is no time for conspiracy theories! The military will do what's right."
 Brazil.75.t: "Military High Command Proposes GLO"
 Brazil.75.d: "As the invaders in the Federal District run rampant, it seems that not even the might of the Federal Police has been able (or willing) to break through and disperse the protests. Instead, the vandals have been allowed to roam the government buildings, pillaging and making a mockery of the Brazilian institutions. President Geraldo Alckmin and other politicians have been advised to stay away from Brasília until the insurrection is dealt with.\n\nIn a discussion with the governor of the Federal District, Alckmin has negotiated the possibility of a federal intervention, as predicted in article 34 of the constitution, which would temporarily allow the federal government more direct control over security matters in the capital. However, the army high command has approached the president with a different proposal - a GLO, or Guarantee of Law and Order. The officers argue that the Federal Police has proven innefective at handling protests of this magnitude, and that the military should handle it instead. The GLO enables the army to effectively operate as police, breaking the protests and performing arrests. This would be more of a hands-off approach for Alckmin's administration, but at the same time the president couldn't help but feel that the military has second intentions with their suggestion.\n\nRegardless, a decision had to be made soon if the country was to be brought back to norm."
 Brazil.75.a: "There is no need for a GLO, the federal police will take care of it."
 Brazil.75.b: "The army shall clear the rabble out. Go ahead."
 Brazil.76.t: "An Unexpected Offer From The Military"
 Brazil.76.d: "With the Federal District overran by leftist rioters, a group of army generals close to Bolsonaro have come to the president with a proposal. The officers led by Braga Netto suggest that the president enact a Guarantee of Law and Order (GLO) which is an executive mechanism that would allow the military to act as the police force and clamp down on the riots. To further persuade [BRA.GetLeader] towards enacting the GLO, the officers have added in the possibility of using the cover of the GLO to restrict some constitutional rights and raise the power of the executive in what would effectively be a self-coup.\n\n[BRA.GetLeader] has taken some time to discuss the offer with the rest of his family. While the offer was tempting, it also felt unnecessary after having sucesfully secured the election by legal means. Some family members have even brought up a concern that this offer could be a trap for the military to try to coup Bolsonaro's government, assuming he was no longer relevant to their plans. A decision was ultimately made:"
 Brazil.76.a: "We remained in power by the four lines and we intend to keep it that way!"
 Brazil.76.b: "After all, why not? We've come this far... The GLO shall be put in place!"
 Brazil.77.t: "Military Enforces Law and Order!"
 Brazil.77.d: "Concerning development in the capital today, as military batallions have been spotted engaging with the ongoing insurrection opposing the 2022 election results. In the last few days, rioters have invaded government buildings in Brasília and other state capitals around the country, even engaging federal police officers in armed conflicts in some instances. Army divisions were reported to be moving towards rioter-controlled areas all around the country, with a significant contingent in the Federal District sieging the Plaza of the Three Powers.\n\nIn a statement directed to the Brazilian nation, general Braga Netto has said that the Brazilian high command has deemed the republican powers incapable of maintaining law and order following the escalation of the riots, and has therefore decided to take the initiative to stamp out the movement, calling it an effective Guarantee of Law and Order (GLO), an executive device that enables the military to temporarily act as a policing force. President [BRA.GetLeader] claims that the high command never discussed this choice with the administration, let alone get the orders for it. Opinions on the matter have been divided, with progressives calling it a blatant military coup attempt while reactionaries have praised the army's initiative."
 Brazil.77.a: "Hold on, we did not approve of this!"
 Brazil.78.t: "Bolsonaro Asked About Rising Covid-19 Cases"
 Brazil.78.d: "During a press conference at the Palácio da Alvorada last evening, president Jair Bolsonaro was asked about the Covid-19 situation in the country and whether Brazil could see a scenario similar to the US, which has become the country with the most Covid-19 cases in the world amidst ongoing political instability. The president dismissed such concerns, claming that \"many Brazilians have already been infected and thus acquired antibodies, which helps this thing to not spread\". The president also said \"Brazilians must be studied, they can't catch anything, you'll see a guy jump in sewage and nothing will happen to him\".\n\nThe statement has proven controversial between supporters of the president and those concerned about the pandemic situation."

 Brazil.79.d: "As the Covid-19 death toll rises in Brazil, president Jair Bolsonaro was asked by a journalist about the number of casualties, responding \"hey man, I'm not a gravedigger, alright?\". This came after other statements made by the president to similar questions, that \"everyone dies someday\" and that Brazilians must \"man up\" if they wish to fight the virus.\n\nTo many, this statement comes in very bad taste as the number of deaths to Covid reaches the thousands."

 Brazil.80.d: "Bolsonaro has worked with his health ministry in order to push for an \"experimental\" chloroquine-based treatment against Covid-19. While the president has pushed for unrestricted usage of the substance, he admitted that it might prove innefective against Covid-19 in the future, but that it is a risk he'd rather take.\n\nBolsonaro has reassured that nobody will be forced to be medicated with the substance, calling it a \"democratic\" treatment. He also joked \"those on the right take chloroquine, those on the left, Tubaína\"."
 Brazil.80.a: "Hey, at least it's not horse medicine."
 Brazil.81.t: "President Criticizes Vaccine Efforts"
 Brazil.81.d: "\"Those who join the vaccine pile, and only the vaccine pile, are useful idiots\" - said Bolsonaro during one of his livestreams to his followers. \"When I offered medications back then, folk struck back\". These statements were made as early trials of Brazil's own Covid-19 vaccine, named Coronavac, have entered early trials. The prototype is being developed in conjunction with Chinese pharmaceutical companies by the Butantã Institute.\n\nMeanwhile, Bolsonaro has also talked about a potential virtual meeting with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in order to address the importation of an experimental anti-cancer spray that, according to the president, could help against Covid-19."
 Brazil.81.a: "The vaccines are turning people into alligators!"
 Brazil.82.t: "Bolsonaro Points To Budget Amidst Covid Outbreak"
 Brazil.82.d: "As Covid-19 infections and deaths soar in Brazil, president Jair Bolsonaro has stated in a talk to his supporters that Brazil is \"broke\" and that he could not do anything. The president has blamed Covid-19 for the situation the country is currently in, and also pointed fingers at the media for allegedly blowing it out of proportion. \"Chief, Brazil is broke, chief. I can't do anything. I wish I could tweak the income tax tables, then you got this virus\", the president stated.\nAccording to the health ministry, Brazil is close to reaching 200 thousand deaths from Covid, one of the worst curves of the pandemic seen in any country. While vaccine trials are underway, it seems that there's no relief for the Brazilian people in the near future."
 Brazil.82.a: "Maybe check the junk folder for any vaccine deals at this point?"

 Brazil.83.d: "With the daily death toll reaching new highs, things have gotten heated during a recent presidential TV statement as Bolsonaro lashed out at the criticism to his Covid-19 handling. \"Enough sissiness, enough crying!\", the president shouted at the audience. Bolsonaro also attacked those who demand the government purchase vaccines, calling them \"idiots\".\n\nThe statement comes in bad taste as even the president's own supporters have started to question his ability to manage the pandemic. However, a die-hard sect remains, trusting the presidents methods and questioning the real extent of the outbreak."
 Brazil.83.a: "Will he ever shut up?"
 Brazil.84.t: "Bolsonaro Is Covid-19 Positive!"
 Brazil.84.d: "The president's administration has confirmed today that Jair Bolsonaro has been diagnosed with Covid-19. While this has come as a shock to many of his supporters, the opposition and even some of his allies seem unphased by the news, pointing out the many times Bolsonaro ignored Covid guidelines and has gathered with his followers. To many, it's been a miracle that he didn't catch it earlier.\n\nThe president's state is stable, and he will remain in office, working virtually. Bolsonaro is expected to make a full recovery in a few weeks. Rumours around the presidential palace are that Bolsonaro has secretly gotten himself vaccinated during the early Coronavac trials, even though the president has consistently belittled vaccination as a preventative measure against Covid. Regardless, this development marks the culmination of Bolsonaro's covid policy, or lack thereof."
 Brazil.84.a: "Vaso ruim não quebra."
 Brazil.85.t: "Our Options Regarding The Oil Crisis"
 Brazil.85.d: "The impacts of the Saudi Oil Crisis on the Brazilian society have been left unchecked since 2020. While the Brazilians have managed to adapt to their current conditions, the combined effect of the oil crisis and coronavirus pandemic have taken their toll and the people are demanding action from our administration.\n\nOur main weapon against this crisis is the Brazilian oil company Petrobrás. It is a mixed-capital enterprise, open to private investors but with an enforced majority government share. Many financial elites and members of the centrist political wing have suggested we shift Petrobrás into a more open-capital enterprise, which would make it much more attractive to private investors. The gains from the added capital could then be paired with negotiations with Russian oil companies, allowing for a swift return to normalcy.\n\nHowever, politicians at both ends of the spectrum have argued we take a more autarkic route by tightening our grip on Petrobrás and investing heavily in bolstering our fuel refining facilities, aiming towards complete fuel self-sustainability. It would incur heavy costs in advance and take longer to bear fruit, but would pay off more in the long term."
 Brazil.85.a: "Our options are there. Time for action."
 Brazil.86.t: "Our Covid Recovery Plan"
 Brazil.86.d: "The Brazilian people have suffered under covid-19 for far too long. The chamber, senate and executive have been working together in drafting a plan towards full eradication of the pandemic and recovery, and thus far two camps have formed.\n\nThe deputies in the chamber believe that the best course of action would be to maintain the current \"local autonomy\" approach where measures are taken at the municipal and state level. This has the advantage of better tailoring policy towards the situation on the ground at every municipality, but also opens up the possibility of local politics to get in the way of recovery.\n\nMembers of the administration have suggested instead a federal plan to be enforced across the entire country. Having the power of the federal government would make these policies easier to enforce and be held to scrutiny, however we can also expect pushback as people across the country are currently disilusioned with the government's handling of the pandemic so far.\n\nFinally, the military has stepped in and proposed an alternative approach: Martial Law. It would allow for a swift recovery from both the pandemic and the political instability plaguing the country, but such an extreme measure would seem unwarranted unless the situation on the streets have really reached their lowest point. Key politicians have also warned that giving the military this much authority over the country could be risky."

 Brazil.87.t: "Military General in The President's Seat"
 Brazil.87.d: "With the ousting of Jair Bolsonaro from office, his Vice-President Hamilton Mourão has taken his place as the Brazilian succession of power dictates. Not only this makes this the second time in a row that a Vice-President has effectively took the president's office in Brazil, but Mourão's military background also makes him the first military officer to sit in the presidential seat since the dictatorship's end in 85.\n\nThe image of a general in office has elicited memories and fears of a return to the dark days of the military dictatorship in many Brazilians, but it has also rallied many who hold that era in high regard, with reactionary manifestations giving the go-ahead for an alleged military coup.\n\nSo far, Mourão has stated that he does not intend to govern as a general, but as a president. However he has also stated that \"given the extraordinary circumstances the Brazilian society finds itself in, unusual measures may be warranted\". While the controversial Jair Bolsonaro may be out, the new president seems to be leaving the Brazilian society more on edge than ever."
 Brazil.87.a: "Let's hope he keeps his promises."
 Brazil.88.t: "A Meeting With The High Command"
 Brazil.88.d: "\"Quite frankly, I had low expectations for martial law, but I suppose Brazilians are a meek people\". Members of the Brazilian high command had summoned the interim president Hamilton Mourão for a meeting behind curtains. Many of the Brazilian active generals were present, and knowing they were surrounded by fellow military men, many of them weren't afraid to speak their minds. \"And what about the so-called Captain? Is he gonna be causing any headaches?\", \"absolutely not. He's made for a great scapegoat for the media.\". Mourão Interjected: \"That doesn't mean we're in the clear though. Bolsonaro may be defeated, but we still have to deal with that ex-convict in the upcoming elections. You know the Brazilian people will fall for his rethoric hook line and sinker. And I would argue he's even worse than the failed Captain.\"\n\nThe room stood in silence for a few moments, until one officer spoke up: \"The Americans are busy going at each other's throats. The Europeans are too worried about Russia to look our way. We have the entire country on lockdown already. That's the opportunity of a lifetime! If we don't take this chance now, who knows when the next one will be\". Silence again. Mourão directed his tone at him: \"What are you proposing, general?\".\n\n\"That we take our country back, sir\"."

 Brazil.90.t: "Firebomb Attack Linked To Integralist Leader"
 Brazil.90.d: "Rio de Janeiro's state police have identified a suspect of participating in last year's firebombing attacks to head officer of media production group \"Porta dos Fundos\" on December 24th Christmas Eve. The suspect is Eduardo Fauzi Richard Cerquise, president of the Rio de Janeiro chapter of the Brazilian Integralist Front (FIB), a far-right neo-integralist group. Fauzi is also affiliated with PSL, Bolsonaro's former political party. Search and seizure operations have been executed at Fauzi's home, but the suspect has not yet been located and is considered at large.\n\nThe attack has been reinvidicated by the \"Command of Popular Nationalist Insurgency\" group, which claimed to have acted in response to the producer's Netflix Christmas special titled \"A Primeira Tentação de Cristo\", which depicts Jesus Christ as a gay man in a relationship with an apostle. FIB has thus far disavowed Fauzi and the attacks, claiming that the suspect's links to the organization are not formal and that FIB hasn't had contact with him since December 26th."

 Brazil.91.t: "Monarchist Sentiment On The Rise Online"
 Brazil.91.d: "If social media trends are anything to go by, it seems that the Brazilian far-right has found a new cause: The return of the Brazilian monarchy. Ended in November 15th 1889, Brazil's empire years are seen by some as the nation's strongest moment in history, an era that in their perspective was unjustly ended in favor of the establishment of a corrupt republic.\n\nRecently, many \"traditionalist\" online groups have seen an increase in followers, with the \"National Restoration Union\" (UNR) being at the forefront of the movement. These groups call for the rejection of what they consider \"modern liberal degeneracy\" in favor of a return to traditional values. They also are for the abolition of the republican system and the return of the Brazilian monarchy under its alleged rightful heir, imperial house member Antônio João de Orléans e Bragança.\n\nWhile groups such as UNR see significant online presence, their operations on the ground have been limited with many doubting they could ever become a viable political force in the country and dismissing it as simply a loud group of social media LARPers."

 #Civil War Events
 Brazil.civilwar.1.t: "Military Crackdown in Brasília"
 Brazil.civilwar.1.d: "Under the authority of the GLO, the Brazilian military has encircled the capital protesters and began sieging the encampments. While the vandals are not expected to pose much of a threat, the army has opted for a slow and careful approach in order to avoid escalating the situation and causing unnecessary deaths, making use of non-lethal armaments such as riot shields and smoke grenades to disperse the crowds before moving in for the arrests. While many gains have been made, the military has also reported that some of the protesters appear to have evaded the siege and are reorganizing outside of main areas and has advised the citizens of Brasília to stay put and report any unusual behaviors directly to the army."
 Brazil.civilwar.1.a: "Desperate times call for desperate measures."
 Brazil.civilwar.2.t: "State of Siege in The Federal District"
 Brazil.civilwar.2.d: "Army officers in charge of the Brasília operation have reported today that while the epicenter of the insurrection around the government buildings has been completely dispersed and dealt with, many of the protesters have slipped through the cracks and reorganized in the outskirts of the capital. This has developed as other protest cells across the country have also experienced escalation as a response to the actions of the military, prompting the organizing of similar counter-protest operations in other major cities such as Rio de Janeiro and Salvador. Under reasoning of the insurgency in Brasília having moved underground, the military has opted to enact a state of siege in the Federal District. Movement in and out of the region will be restricted, and military checkpoints are to be set up across the city, performing random checks on civilians with the intent of catching insurrectionists.\n\nThis decision has proven controversial across the country, with leftists warning of a potential military overreach and even coup attempt, while pro-military reactionaries have praised the army for taking the \"necessary measures to secure our country in such dire times\"."
 Brazil.civilwar.2.a: "That's a bit excessive, don't you think?"
 Brazil.civilwar.3.t: "Politicians Advised Against Travelling to Brasília"
 Brazil.civilwar.3.d: "Concerning development in the Brazilian political sphere today, as many key deputies and senators allege to have received an anonymous message warning them to not return to Brasília after their holiday period is up. The message, which is identical for all the receivers, appears to be less of a threat and more of a tip by a military dissenter, albeit the possibility of it being a false flag has not yet been discarded. The message claims that the military intends on purging the chamber, senate and supreme court and that politicians not aligned with reactionary ideologies should avoid travelling to Brasília for their own safety.\n\nThe officers in charge of the Federal District operation have claimed the message to be a hoax intending on discrediting the military, and have reinforced their commitment to the Brazilian republican system and democratic institutions. Still, many politicians have been aprehensive and decided to delay their return to the capital, citing concerns around the reports of military overreach in Brasília and pointing at the ongoing examples of political violence seen across the American continent."
 Brazil.civilwar.3.a: "Will they be \"working from home\"?"
 Brazil.civilwar.4.t: "Security Zone Declared in The Federal District"
 Brazil.civilwar.4.d: "The crisis in the Brazilian political sphere has entered a new chapter today as the officers in charge of the Federal District pacification operation have declared it to be a \"Special Security Zone\" following a previous decision to declare a state of siege. The high command has elected a military committee to take charge of matters in the district, with General Braga Netto in charge of the military junta. This decision has been controversial in the Brazilian high command, with an internal faction opposing it and demanding an end to what they call \"a blatant coup attempt\". Other officers and even some reactionary deputies have stated that this decision is necessary to guarantee the stability of the country and prevent it from falling into an internal conflict similar to that of the US, Mexico and Colombia.\n\nWhile many politicians still remain in their home states and refuse to travel to Brasília until the military leaves the Federal District, Jair Bolsonaro and his allies have returned to the government buildings in the capital. Their return was unimpeded by the military, and the barebones one-sided government in the capital has claimed it will be resuming its duties soon, whether the rest of the representatives are present or not."
 Brazil.civilwar.4.a: "Our country is splitting in half..."
 Brazil.civilwar.5.t: "Emergency Government to Be Set Up in Rio"
 Brazil.civilwar.5.d: "Believing their duties to be jeopardized by the military control of Brasília, politicians aligned with the administration have called for the formation of what they're calling an \"Emergency Government\" in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Many deputies and senators have communicated to their constituents that they believe the military is using the threat of violence to keep civil servants under control, and that they cannot accept to remain locked out of their political rights and responsibilities. The project has seen the support of both Lula da Silva and Geraldo Alckmin, who have agreed to join forces against the threat of the Military Junta in Brasília.\n\nThe response from the Federal District has been to denounce the initiative, calling it unconstitutional and based on fearmongering. A rift appears to have formed between the politicians that have returned to the capital and those that have rallied behind what is now being called the \"Rio Government\", as if the country had two governments struggling for legitimacy."
 Brazil.civilwar.5.a: "Where have I seen this before...?"
 Brazil.civilwar.6.t: "Opposition Government to Be Set Up in Rio"
 Brazil.civilwar.6.d: "Politicians in opposition to Bolsonaro's administration and the ongoing military crackdown in the Federal District have formed today what they are calling an \"Emergency Government\" in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Many of them have expressed concerns of encroaching authoritarianism by the president, some even classifying his use of the military against the ongoing insurrection as a \"self-coup\". The initiative has been endorsed by former 2022 presidential candidates Lula da Silva and Geraldo Alckmin, who have formed a coalition between their supporters and a defacto parallel government to the Brasília administration.\n\nThe Federal District has denounced the initiative, reflecting the coup implications back at Lula and Alckmin whom are being accused of attempting to usurp a \"democratically elected president and his cabinet\" through the insurrections and subsequent response. A rift appears to have formed between the politicians that have returned to the capital and those that have rallied behind what is now being called the \"Rio Government\", as if the country had two governments struggling for legitimacy."
 Brazil.civilwar.6.a: "Where have I seen this before...?"
 Brazil.civilwar.7.t: "President of the Chamber Takes Over The Administration"
 Brazil.civilwar.7.d: "While most of the Brazilian government has been splitting itself into two factions, it seems that a third contender has made a claim on control of the country: President of the Chamber of Deputies Arthur Lira. Lira has claimed that since the situation around the elected president and vice-president is unclear, the legal succession of power dictates that he be the next in line for the position of head of state. Lira has refused to side with either government, claiming instead that he represents the legitimate, unadultered federal government of Brazil and calling forth for like-minded representatives to not side with the Military Junta or Emergency Government and instead maintain the Federative Republic of Brazil alive.\n\nLira's calls however seem to have gone unanswered, as many of the centrist elected officials he hoped to sway have instead opted to join the Rio government under Lula and Alckmin. Lira is also highly unpopular with the Brazilian population, with polls showing an expected high degree of polarization between the other two governments and complete apathy for Lira's so-called administration."
 Brazil.civilwar.7.a: "Can't fault a man for trying."
 Brazil.civilwar.8.t: "Brazilian Popular Front Disavows Lula"
 Brazil.civilwar.8.d: "While the Rio government has managed to unite a wide array of political parties under its cause, it seems that one fringe has been refusing to play ball. The Brazilian Popular Front, who supported Lula in the 2022 elections, have disavowed the Worker's Party for allegedly capitulating to the centrists at a time where the Brazilians demand change more than ever. Popular Front leader Léo Péricles has stated in a speech that \"it's become clear now that Lula and the Worker's Party have betrayed the ideals they once believed in, true socialist democratic ideals, all in favor of maintaining a status quo that has stabbed the working class Brazilian in the back time and time again, the very same status quo that has led to this crisis\".\n\nLeaders of the parties that compose the Popular Front have rallied behind Péricles and withdrawn participation in the Emergency Government, claiming that the front has been developing its own project for the nation and calling for their supporters to stand by. Members of the Worker's Party have responded by lamenting the choice and calling for more unity at a time of  crisis, not division."
 Brazil.civilwar.8.a: "So much for leftist unity!"
 Brazil.civilwar.9.t: "Army Brigades Cut Communications"
 Brazil.civilwar.9.d: "Recent attempts to establish communications with Brazilian Army brigades currently stationed in the Federal District and other parts of the country have resulted in radio silence, as it appears that commanders have abandoned standard comms channels in favor of parallel ones. Members of the high command have also gone incommunicado, with rumors suggesting that most of the Brazilian three-star generals have travelled to the Federal District to join the military administration. Navy and airforce officers have also returned no response, with many assuming that the armed forces of Brazil are currently picking their sides in the background."
 Brazil.civilwar.9.a: "We're on our own..."
 Brazil.civilwar.10.t: "Popular Front Uprising in Salvador!"
 Brazil.civilwar.10.d: "The ongoing insurrection appear to have developed to a new stage in the city of Salvador today. A massive Brazilian Popular Front march led by movement leader Léo Péricles and attended by many of the group's party members turned violent as municipal police force had been ordered to disperse the crowds and arrest key figures including Péricles himself, under allegations of \"subversive political actions\". While Péricles did not resist the attempted arrest, the marches turned into riots and the protesters were able to fend off the police and prevent the arrests from taking place. Eventually, police stations and government buildings were invaded, and both municipal and state governments deposed and replaced by Popular Front figureheads. The news of these events have spread to other cities in the Brazilian Northeast, where similar riots are also taking place.\n\nFPB leaders including Péricles himself could not yet be reached by media outlets for a statement, but local independent newspapers and social media posts appear to suggest that the takeovers were done as a response to the \"unjustified arrest and censorship attempts\", in what is now being called the \"Salvador Uprising\"."
 Brazil.civilwar.10.a: "Is a Brazilian Revolution in the horizon?"
 Brazil.civilwar.11.t: "Brazilian Institutions Continue To Collapse"
 Brazil.civilwar.11.d: "The consequences of the ongoing political crisis in the country continue to worsen. Trust in the federal government is at an all-time low, leading many municipal and state administrations to declare a state of exception and override federal mandates in favor of autonomous governance. The collapse of federal institutions has also led to a complete standstill of logistics and bureaucracy at the national level, leading to many remote and landlocked settlements to experience shortages in food, consumer goods and pharmaceutical materials as well as deadlocks in public service processes.\n\nFeeling forsaken by the republic, many Brazilians are seeking for help in any way they can, turning to their local governments, popular movements, NGOs and even corporations for any sort of aid. As the grip of the federal government in the country slips, many are expecting municipalities and states to turn to either the military administration in Brasília, the republican remnants in Rio, or even the popular government proclaimed in Salvador. The possibility of states and entire regions outright declaring independence has also not been discarded."

 Brazil.civilwar.12.t: "State of São Paulo Declares Neutrality"
 Brazil.civilwar.12.d: "The Federative Republic of Brazil has officially began to crack today, as São Paulo state governor Tarcísio Freitas has declared a \"state-wide state of emergency\". The Legislative Assembly of the State of São Paulo has voted to grant the state government emergency powers with 62 votes, effectively allowing the state to operate independently from the rest of the country temporarily.\n\nIn a press statement, Tarcísio has said that \"the Brazilian federal government finds itself currently in a state of uncertainty\" and has urged the state and municipal governments of São Paulo to \"seek Paulista interests first and foremost\". The governor has affirmed that the emergency powers shall only be used for the purposes of protecting Brazil's most developed and populous state from any potential conflict that may break out in the near future, and that when the crisis has subsided, the state shall rejoin the union.\n\nWhile this move is being presented as a declaration of neutrality, many Brazilians have been quick to point out Tarcísio's alignment with Bolsonaro as a reason not to take him for his words, however the consensus appears to be that the governor has a genuine concern for a potential civil war spreading to his state."
 Brazil.civilwar.12.a: "Ask the Californians how well neutrality defended them in their civil war."
 Brazil.civilwar.13.t: "Northern States Go Dark"
 Brazil.civilwar.13.d: "Since the start of the ongoing political crisis, the Northern regions have been the most impacted. Still recovering from the aftershocks of Covid-19, the Amazonian states have suffered the most from the collapse of federal-level institutions, with many remote and indigenous settlements finding themselves stranded and rationing food, medicine and whatever else they can.\n\nCommunications with the region have already become difficult, but last night they appear to have completely ceased. To this moment, the federal government has not been able to establish a picture of the situation on the ground in the Amazonian states. But rumors suggest that native organizations, united under the Coordination of Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon (COIAB), have taken control of the weakened local administrations and declared the Northern regions a sovereign commune as a response from continued neglect by the federal government."
 Brazil.civilwar.13.a: "A native insurgency? Come on now."
 Brazil.civilwar.14.t: "Southern States Declare Independence"
 Brazil.civilwar.14.d: "Already having experienced a surge in popularity since 2020 due to widespread polarization, the Southern independence movement has found massive support recently from the populations of the three Southern states of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. Citizens of these states have cited the repeated failures of the federal government in containing and stabilizing the ongoing political crisis as well as concerns of their regions getting dragged into a major armed conflict as the main motivators behind their support for independence.\n\nThe push for independence has been heralded by the \"O Sul É Meu País\" movement (The South Is My Country). The organization was founded in 1992 and while it has failed to gain traction for the most part of three decades, recent developments have led to a massive influx of memberships. Movement leader Ivan Feloniuk has been able to reach an agreement with the state governments of the three southern states in which they are to no longer swear allegiance to the former Brazilian nation, but a new \"sovereign Southern nation\" to be established by the organization.\n\nWhile the decision has been met with some skepticism by significant portions of Southern Brazilians, most seem apathetic or even cautiously optimistic of it, believing that the Brazilian nation is no more and approving of the initiative to establish a new state through peaceful means. Politicians outside of the South have denounced the move, however, claiming it to be an illegal and opportunistic attempt at secession. Whether this new state can stand on its own or is doomed to collapse remains to be seen."
 Brazil.civilwar.14.a: "They always thought too highly of themselves."
 Brazil.civilwar.15.t: "Arthur Lira Flees The Country!"
 Brazil.civilwar.15.d: "The last bastion of the Sixth Brazilian Republic has finally crumbled, as self-proclaimed interim president Arthur Lira has been reported to have fled the country. The news comes at no surprise, as 97% of Brazilians surveyed saw Lira's administration as an empty attempt at a power grab and believed one of the other claimants to the mandate to have more legitimacy. The president of the chamber had been governing from an unknown location, assumed to be within his home state of Alagoas, and had been able to get all but half a dozen sycophants on his side, with the overwhelming majority of federal politicians having opted to align with the Military Junta, the Emergency Government or the Popular Front.\n\nArthur Lira has been seen embarking on a flight to Lisbon from the Maceió International Airport. Other passengers have filmed and approached the politician, asking questions and heckling him. Lira refused to answer any questions or provide any explanation and just avoided confrontation and exposure during the embarking procedure.\n\nWhile Lira has not formally abdicated from the Brazilian presidential seat, many have seen this as the last nail in the coffin of the former establishment. All that remains now is the military administration stationed in the Federal District, the emergency government installed in Rio de Janeiro, and the ongoing revolutionary front emerging in Salvador. With all three factions maintaining their claim for the mandate over Brazil and no room for diplomacy in sight, it seems that a conflict between them is inevitable."
