 BRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Once heralded as \"The Country of the Future\", it seemed that history had other plans for Brazil. The end of the commodities boom in 2014 was followed by financial crisis and a swift end to PT's strong grip on the country. The country would then see a complete reactionary shift, but after four years it seems that the nation has been left adrift with no plan or strategy for it in place. If Brazil is to live up to its hype it must decide on a path forward, or risk being left behind in history."
