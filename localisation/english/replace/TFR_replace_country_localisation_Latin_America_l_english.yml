 NIC.1.t: "The FSLN Proclaims the Central American Federation"
 NIC.1.d: "Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) declared the formation of the Central American Federation in a surprise announcement today. In a statement, Ortega pledged to unite the Central American nations by any means necessary, sparking fears of conflict in the region.\n\nThe proclamation comes amidst the backdrop of the ongoing Second American Civil War, which has seen the United States preoccupied with internal strife, leaving a power vacuum in the region. Ortega's ambitions have met with support from the governments of Cuba, Venezuela, and China, who have backed the move as a way to strengthen regional autonomy and counterbalance US influence. However, other Central American nations, including Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama, have condemned Ortega's declaration, interpreting it as a veiled threat of aggression. These nations believe Nicaragua's ultimate goal is to seize control of the strategically vital Panama Canal, taking advantage of the current instability in the United States. In response to the escalating tension, the Organization of American States (OAS) has called for an emergency meeting to discuss the potential threat to regional stability posed by the Central American Federation's proclamation."

 NIC.2.t: "Canal War"
 NIC.2.d: "In a shocking development, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega announced today that his country is officially declaring war on neighboring Costa Rica and Panama, escalating tensions in the Central American region. The declaration comes just weeks after Ortega and the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) proclaimed the formation of the Central American Federation and vowed to unite the region by any means necessary. Nicaragua's aggressive stance has caused alarm among its neighbors and the international community.\n\nBoth Costa Rica and Panama, countries without standing armies, have called for an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS) to discuss the crisis and seek support from other member nations. In the meantime, they have mobilized their national police forces and security agencies to bolster border security and maintain public order. Countries around the world have expressed concern over the sudden escalation of conflict in Central America, with many calling for immediate international intervention to prevent the possible catastrophic repercussions this war may have."

 latin_america.20.d: "Peru president Pedro Castillo has dissolved Congress and declared a \"state of exception\" following a judicial crisis in the country. The decree came moments before he was due to face an impeachment vote. Castillo argued that the Peruvian Congress has been serving oligopolistic interests and working with the Constitutional Court in order to undermine the executive branch's powers and create a \"congressional dictatorship\".\n\nThe move garnered a surprising amount of support from the president's coalition and popular supporters, leading to a deadlock in Congress and allowing Castillo's decree to take effect. The president also found an unexpected support from the Peruvian Armed Forces, who seemed unhappy with the rampant display of \"lawfare\" against the president and the executive, and have praised Castillo's willingness to \"bring some order to the house\".\n\nIn the public sphere, the decision was met with divided opinions, with many protests erupting and clashing with rallies in support of the president. While the situation seems to have stabilized for now, only time will tell if Castillo's experiment will last."
 latin_america.20.a: "Bold move by Castillo."
 latin_america.21.t: "Peru President Ousted Following Alleged Coup Attempt"
 latin_america.21.d: "Peru's president Pedro Castillo has been removed from office and detained on charges of \"rebellion\ after he announced he would shutter congress and install a \"government of exception\" - just hours before he was due to face an impeachment vote.\n\nThe vote came after Castillo ordered a night-time curfew and the reorganisation of the judiciary and prosecutor's office, which is investigating him for alleged corruption and influence trafficking - charges which he denies.\n\nCastillo's vice-president Dina Boluarte described the move as a coup attempt, and hours later was sworn in as the new president, becoming the first female head of state in Peru's history. The day of high drama put an end to Castillo's tumultuous 17 months in power, which has already seen five cabinets, more than 80 ministers, six criminal investigations and two failed attempts to impeach him."
