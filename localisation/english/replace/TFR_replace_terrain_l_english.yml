 beijing: "Beijing"
 beijing_desc: "----\n§9The vibrant and colorful Wangfujing commercial street is just a wall away from the serene, history-soaked atmosphere of the ancient hutongs. The opulent gardens of past emperors overlook the gray government buildings adorned with red stars and hammer-and-sickle symbols. Only in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, can such strange yet harmonious scenes be found. Since the Yuan Dynasty made it their capital in 1271, Beijing has weathered countless storms and seen many rulers come and go. This unique history has shaped the city's north-south axis and grid-like layout, while also cultivating a distinct urban spirit and civic culture that Beijingers hold dear.\nTo their fellow countrymen, Beijingers often play complex roles, blending enthusiasm and arrogance, openness and rigidity. Despite being closest to the heart of the nation's power, they harbor an unspoken disdain for authority: "In Beijing, a single brick thrown could hit a dozen bureau chiefs." As the front line of the Republic's openness and exchange with the outside world, they also hold on to amusing and quaint traditions, from their distinctive accent to their fondness for the fermented drink "douzhi." This reflects China itself: an ancient yet youthful nation.\nToday, with Beijing as its capital, the People's Republic has over seventy years of history. This ancient city has witnessed both the peaceful prosperity and turbulent times of past dynasties, as well as the rise, fall, and resurgence of the nation. Looking to the future, where will the current leaders of Beijing take this city? Perhaps only history can provide the answer.§!"

It ultimately welcomed the sunrise after enduring prolonged darkness. Today, Tianjin stands as northern China's largest industrial city, serving both as Beijing's crucial maritime gateway and the core of the Bohai Rim Economic Circle. This thriving port continues its centuries-old tradition as a bustling hub for domestic and international trade, where merchants converge just as they did hundreds of years ago.§!"

From the serene beauty of Mount Qingcheng to the history of loyalty honored at the Wuhou Shrine, Chengdu offers a fascinating blend of old and new. Its street-side teahouses, world-class fighter jet production lines, giant pandas at the breeding base, and the bustling Tianfu Square in the city center all highlight its diversity.\nWhat truly sets Chengdu apart, however, is its relaxed pace of life, a striking contrast to the fast-paced, economically driven rhythms found in other major Chinese cities. This balance between tradition and modernity gives Chengdu its unique charm, showcasing how the wave of modernization has shaped this vibrant city in southwestern China.§!"

Its stunning nightscape is a testament to a golden era, while the city's rivers have given rise to a unique river culture. Dockside traditions, the "Gelaohui" brotherhood, and the once-dominant urban gangs all contribute to Chongqing's raw, mysterious aura.\nFrom a wartime capital preserving China's spirit to becoming a municipality that accommodated migrants from the "Three Gorges" project, Chongqing has always adapted to change. Today, as a key player in the big data industry and the economic engine of the Sichuan Basin, it continues to evolve.

After Westerners arrived, the city opened up to commerce and became the birthplace of China's earliest modern industries, although much of this progress was divided among foreign powers. Due to its large labor force, Shanghai also became the cradle of the Communist Party of China.\nIn 1949, Shanghai was liberated by the People's Liberation Army, and for the first time, the city's future was truly in the hands of the Chinese people, marking the start of a new era. Over the past seventy years, particularly after the reform and opening-up policies and the development of the Pudong New Area, Shanghai's growth has been remarkable.

Over forty years ago, locals navigated the reeds with simple fishing boats. Today, Shenzhen has evolved into one of the largest cities in southern China - and indeed, in the world - by economic scale. It has become a symbol of China's rise. Without the reform and opening-up policy, this land might have remained dormant.

However, this wealth also made Guangzhou a target, and it became a prize for foreign powers. After enduring many trials, this city has emerged even more brilliant. While Guangzhou's development lagged behind Shenzhen's after the reform and opening-up, it remains the undeniable center of the Pearl River Delta economic zone.

The unity and courage displayed during the Battle of Wuhan made the roar of this city's resilience resonate across the land.

The city's complex modern history is etched into landmarks like the Puppet Manchurian Palace and the Eight Ministries complex, relics of its wartime role as a pseudo-capital. Reborn as the cradle of China's automotive industry with the founding of FAW, Changchun now leads the nation's green mobility revolution through cutting-edge new energy and smart vehicle technologies. Anchored by academic powerhouses like Jilin University and the iconic Changchun Film Studio (the "Cradle of New Chinese Cinema"), the city harmonizes scholarly depth with industrial vigor, embodying poet Ai Qing's ode: "My eyes brim with tears, for my love of this land runs soul-deep."§!"

The vast Xinghai Square mirrors its ambition as a Belt and Road linchpin, while summer streets come alive with the pulse of Fashion Week and the golden froth of beer festivals. Now a Northeast Asian shipping titan, Dalian harnesses deep-sea riches and smart manufacturing to bridge continents.

Over the years, by the early 20th century, the city saw the establishment of broad-gauge Russian railways and the construction of the South Manchuria Railway by the Japanese. To this day, Zhongshan Road retains its hybrid appearance, with Gothic window sashes and floral decorations. The rusting gantry cranes and foundry workshops in Tiexi District capture the industrial memory of early heavy industry in the People's Republic of China, while the fighter jet production lines at the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation continue to embody the national defense spirit of the Third Front Movement.\nA city that intertwines dynastic changes, colonial imprints, and the rise of industrialization, Shenyang persistently seeks its contemporary identity amidst the layers of its rich history.§!"

An icon of Taiwan’s economic miracle and rapid development since the 1960s, Taipei transformed from a flat, primitive city into a bustling metropolis. It is home to Taipei 101, a skyscraper that was once the tallest building in the world.\nDespite the deconstruction of old Qing Dynasty walls, Taipei, like many other large cities, is considered a defensive fortification in itself against potential invaders.

The city is famed for landmarks like Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, and the beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema. Rio's Carnival is one of the world's largest festivals, showcasing samba music and elaborate parades. It is also home to Maracanã Stadium, one of the largest and most historic football stadiums in the world.\n\nThe city hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique urban landscape blending mountains, sea, and architecture. Despite challenges like socioeconomic disparities, Rio remains a major cultural and economic center in Latin America. Despite its cultural and economic influence, Rio faces significant challenges, including poverty, corruption, and violent crime, particularly in its many favelas, which impact daily life and urban development.§!\n\n§GSamba De Janeiro!§!"

São Paulo hosts major events like the São Paulo Art Biennial and the São Paulo Fashion Week, and is home to landmarks such as the São Paulo Museum of Art (MASP) and Ibirapuera Park.

 brasilia_desc: "----\n§9Brasília is the capital of Brazil, established in 1960 as part of President Juscelino Kubitschek's "Fifty Years in Five" initiative to drive development into the country's interior. The city was designed under the Plano Piloto ('Pilot Plan') by urban planner Lúcio Costa and architect Oscar Niemeyer, featuring a unique, airplane-shaped layout.\n\nIts design centers on the Monumental Axis, which houses key government buildings like the Palácio do Planalto, National Congress, and Supreme Federal Court, all arranged around the Praça dos Três Poderes. Iconic landmarks include the Cathedral of Brasília and Palácio da Alvorada, contributing to its UNESCO World Heritage status since 1987. Despite its innovative architecture, Brasília faces challenges inherent to its planned layout and urban sprawl, but remains a symbol of Brazilian modernism and political power.§!"
