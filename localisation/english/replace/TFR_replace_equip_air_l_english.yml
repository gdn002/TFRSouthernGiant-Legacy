 AST_strat_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "F-111C (nicknamed "Pig") is a variant of the F-111 Aardvark medium-range interdictor and tactical strike aircraft, developed by General Dynamics to meet Australian requirements. The design was based on the F-111A model but included longer wings and strengthened undercarriage. The Australian government ordered 24 F-111Cs to equip the RAAF in 1963, but the aircraft were not delivered until 1973 because of long-running technical problems."

With the introduction of the B-1B Lancer, the USAF had no need for the FB-111, and it was reconfigured back into a tactical role and renamed the F-111G. In 1993 the RAAF purchased 15 of these aircraft to supplement their F-111Cs."

With the introduction of the B-21 in the US arsenal, Australia was able to procure older B-2s to fill the long-held gap of strategic bombers. While RAAF doctrine has had little use for strategic-level attacks, the allure of an aircraft with still-viable stealth technology was too valuable to pass up."

The LRS-B provides operational flexibility across a wide range of military operations. Acquired in the 2030s after intense negoatiations, this upgrade over the previous B-2 design is a very big leap in strategic-level destruction."
