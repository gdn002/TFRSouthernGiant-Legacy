 BM_HISTORY_TITLE: "Brief History"
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME: "Brave New World"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "As the world enters the 21st century, new facets of society begin to form. Political shifts begin as long-existing entities reach further and further from their initial scope. The internet's ability to broadcast any form of expression to the greater audience of the globe creates new pockets within society. New and old conflicts alike are pursued flagrantly and diligently across vast oceans and insignificant lines in the sand. Perhaps it is inevitable that the earth plunges into chaos, again. Perhaps the chaos itself is fleeting. In this world, only you may decide."
 FIRE_NAME: "§YLighting the Match§!"
 FIRE_NAME_DESC: "With the world coming out of the turbulent 2000's and the relatively quiet early 2010's, the world seems ready for its greatest upset since 1991. With the re-election of the anti-establishment Donald Trump fast approaching, looming tensions in both Eastern Europe and Asia along with extremism flaring up in every corner of the globe; the world's forecast already seems bleak and with disturbing reports of a 'novel coronavirus' brewing in China, it seems a match has been lit for this world spanning powder keg."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The European Union is more unpopular than ever before. The British people are quick to blame everything wrong with their country on the officials in Brussels, as well as on the German government in Berlin. The population is deeply split around this one particular issue. Britain has recovered from the economic crisis of 2008 well, but leaving the European Union might destroy the economic progress of the past decade. And even then... is national sovereignity not preferable to minor economic gains?"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "France has faced economic difficulties and major terrorist attacks in Paris, leading to growing social and political tensions. Amid these challenges, public sentiment toward Muslim and Jewish communities has become increasingly polarized. The nationalist party, the Front National, sees an opportunity to gain power in these troubled times.\n\nWill the democratic establishment and French European integration endure, or will France stand on her own like in the good old days?"
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Germany, hit by the refugee crisis, economic hardship, and growing internal resentment toward countries like Greece, Italy, and Spain, is still standing strong. The European Union continues to expand southward, while Germany's policies are increasingly criticized by its neighbors.\n\nIs it worth continuing this path, or is it time to revive old border conflicts and let the soldiers march again?"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Japan is faced with the possibility of war each passing day, as Chinese naval vessels aggressively close into the Senkaku Islands and as North Korean missiles are launched into the stratosphere.  Recently, Article 9 of the Japanese constitution was amended to allow a more active military presence abroad.\n\nWhile this shift toward militarism is unpopular, it may be crucial for maintaining national security in the coming years."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "No country of the G7 and the great four of Europe has been so strongly affected by the economic crisis of 2008 like Italy has. Recovery is slow and government support dwindling. The influx of African migrants is not helping at giving the people the image of internal stability. Italy needs to consider her choices. Surely this is not the time to revive imperialism, but drastic reforms will be necessary..."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The once invincible Eastern giant is slowly awakening. With the Communist Party stronger and more vibrant than ever, China's challenge to the superpower throne is now well underway. However, significant challenges remain: economic imbalances, environmental pollution, simmering internal struggles, and volatile international landscape. The road to the future is fraught with obstacles and perilous twists.\n\nChina will need to confront these challenges head-on, and the future of billions is intricately linked to the outcomes."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "India's economy is rapidly growing, and so is its population. Still not greatly in the international spotlight, the Tiger is well-fed and growling. India is on the hunt, and its prey ever-so unsuspecting."
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Like other Southern European countries, Spain has fallen into economic crisis in 2008, requiring economic stimuli from Northern European economies. Podemos and Ciudadanos have brought a new populism and new uncertainty to the old political system, while Catalonian independence movements are more threatening to Spanish unity than ever.\n\nEconomic Recovery will be a long and rocky path - will Spain stay with Europe and stick to the agreements that prevent immediate disaster - or is the future of Spain a different one from the future of Northern Europe?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it was clear that the road back to glory would not be easy for the Russian Federation. The system and economy were corrupt, the military was large but outdated, and political outreach was weakened, and Russia had to resign itself to being on the sidelines for a decade. Now it hopes to return to the center of attention."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Internally more divided than ever before, externally more challenged than any time since the Cold War ended, the United States isn't living in a national golden age for sure. Her own people are increasingly wary of Chinese aggression, industrial decline, and economic hardship, while public support for American military alliances fades. The next president of the United States will face the task of redefining what it truly means to be the greatest nation on Earth, the land of the free, and the home of the brave."
 BRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Once heralded as \"The Country of the Future\", it seemed that history had other plans for Brazil. The end of the commodities boom in 2014 was followed by financial crisis and a swift end to PT's strong grip on the country. The country would then see a complete reactionary shift, but after four years it seems that the nation has been left adrift with no plan or strategy for it in place. If Brazil is to live up to its hype it must decide on a path forward, or risk being left behind in history."
