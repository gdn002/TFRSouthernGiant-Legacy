 Brazil.1.t: "The Forever Country of The Future"
 Brazil.1.d: "Brazil is described by many things. Soccer. Carnaval. Sunny beaches, favelas and corruption. But perhaps the best way to describe Brazil is the moniker of \"Country of The Future\". Thirty-five years ago, the military regime that had haunted us for two decades had finally thawed, and the Sixth Brazilian Republic was born. While this republic had a bumpy ride at first, compensating for the shortfalls wrought by the dictatorship years and worldwide financial instability, we managed to arrive into the new millennium mostly in one piece.\nWith the new millennium, came new challenges, new ways of thinking, and new opportunities. The global commodities boom combined with the Worker's Party developmentalist policies put us on the road to becoming the country of the future. But our bloated, corrupt establishment slowed us down, and before we could live up to the hype, the boom was over and with it so was the dream.\nSo the Brazilian people called for change, and did it come. The new administration is the complete antithesis to what came before, exchanging developmentalism for austerity and progressivism for tradition. But so far, it has been more of the same with a different coat of paint. Brazil's issues run deeper than what a mere political party switch can solve. If we really want to live up to the hype, we'll need to fight the root cause of our problems, or otherwise be doomed to be the forever country of the future."
 Brazil.1.a: "És belo, és forte, impávido colosso, e o teu futuro espelha essa grandeza."
 Brazil.2.t: "Everything Going to Plan"
 Brazil.2.d: "It is often joked that the Brazilian year does not start proper until after the Carnaval, and as summer finally comes to a close the Brazilian people prepare to go back to their usual lives in the new decade. But within the Palácio do Planalto, the Brazilian presidential palace, the first few weeks of 2020 have been ones of intense discussions. In particular, the same question that every elected president always had at some point in their career could not leave Jair Bolsonaro's mind: What's the problem with Brazilian politics?\nSurely if you asked him, the answer would seem obvious - the Worker's Party and their corruption. But they were out of the picture now, and it was Bolsonaro's time to shine. And yet, it seemed that they hadn't moved forward an inch. The socialists, the liberals, even the military, they all had their shot at handling things and yet they all fell short. Was his own project fated to the same outcome?\nEven though Bolsonaro refused to fully admit, deep down he knew that the issue ran deeper than just mere ideology. It was the establishment itself that had held everyone back for so long. Self-serving interests running everything from the shadows and keeping a puppet show in Brasília. You either played to the tune, or you'd be discarded, like happened with Dilma.\n\nBut what if he could be the one to finally cut the strings and become a true sovereign leader?"
 Brazil.2.a: "We have our work cut out for us."
