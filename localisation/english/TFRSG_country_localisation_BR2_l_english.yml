 #Ideas
 BR2_rural_economy_idea: "The Agrarian Heartland"
 BR2_rural_economy_idea_desc: "While we are fortunate to control parts of Brazil that are very aligned to our ideology and willing to fulfill their patriotic duty, the lands of central Brazil are mostly agrarian with few industrial centers under our command. We must act fast and secure the manufacturing hubs of Brazil, or risk being starved out!"
 BR2_martial_law_idea: "Indefinite State of Siege"
 BR2_martial_law_idea_desc: "What started with riots in the Federal District has developed into a nation-wide uprising, with an illegitimate government in the Southeast, insurrections to the North and Northeast, and even independence movements in the South. As a response, we have enacted a state of siege in all of our controlled territories until this crisis can be dealt with."
 BR2_political_opposition_idea: "Political Opposition"
 BR2_constitutional_crisis_idea: "Constitutional Crisis"
 BR2_constitutional_crisis_idea_desc: "The Brazilian army reserves the right to guarantee law and order when the government fails to do so. While we have attempted to remain within the so called \"four lines of the constitution\", we also cannot jeopardize our mission for the sake of upholding an antiquated and collapsing status quo. Still, there are many who will attempt to use this fact to delegitimize the military and prevent us from fulfilling our duty."
 BR2_trigger_happy_military_idea: "Trigger-Happy Military"
 BR2_trigger_happy_military_idea_desc: "Our soldiers are eager to finally have their combat prowess tested, albeit not so much to be doing so against their fellow countrymen. While the sentiment is good in principle, our troops hold a romanticized view of their duty that not always aligns with the realities in the battlefield. Pair that with a high command that, with all due respect, lacks actual competency, we have our work cut out for us."

 #Summary
 #Events
 Brazil.junta.1.t: "Brasilia Secured"
 Brazil.junta.1.d: ""
 Brazil.junta.1.a: "We must act swiftly."
 Brazil.junta.2.t: "Conflicts of Interest"
 Brazil.junta.2.d: "While we have a strong hold on the population of Central Brazil, the situation around the government isn't as stable as our posture may suggest. Two factions have formed in the administration, one comprised of the former president Jair Bolsonaro and his political allies who claim the presidential mandate, and the other comprised of the military high command who believe they should be in charge of operations since they were the ones to kickstart them.\nJair Bolsonaro has stated that the people of Brazil have elected him to be in charge and while he has praised the army for taking the initiative against his opponents, he's also accused certain members of the high command of \"attempting to usurp the situation to enact a military coup\". The military has refused to provide an answer to these allegations so far.\nIn the fringes, rumors of other groups conspiring against the Military Junta have surfaced: The radical Brazilian Integralist Front, which has stated goals of installing an integralist republican regime in our country; the National Restoration Union, an online radical group which has allied with several pro-monarchist organizations and has been spearheading the movement; and the National Movement For Democracy, an opposition group aligned with the Federal Government that does not recognize Bolsonaro's mandate.\nAs this conflict, we can only expect these cracks to become larger and potentially fracture our grasp on the country, thus we must deal with our opponents as quickly as possible."
 Brazil.junta.2.a: "Focus on the mission."
 Brazil.junta.3.t: "The Opening Act"
 Brazil.junta.3.d: "It has come down to this. The corrupt politicians have refused to comply with our orders to stand down, the rabble in the Northeast is sowing chaos, and the natives in the Amazon suddenly think they can just break away from our nation. We find ourselves surrounded, but we also have the patriotic might of the Brazilian Army on our side. Our soldiers and generals are itching for orders, eager to put down the enemies of the nation and reclaim the country that is rightfully theirs. We cannot afford to hold back any longer while our enemies gather their forces, we must strike as soon as possible and defeat them while they're still weak, or risk getting bogged down. Still, there's no need for recklesness. Our high command has drafted several war plans for each front.\n\nPlan USTRA describes an assault on the so called \"Federal Government\" through the states of Minas Gerais on a wide front. We expect fierce combat in the hilly terrains of Eastern Brazil, but the regional infrastructure should make logistics trivial and some of the country's most developed regions would be on the line.\n\nPlan ANGICO sees instead an incursion into the Northeastern region against the Popular Front, through the state of Tocantins. We expect little resistance from the insurgents, but the narrow frontline could present logistical bottlenecks and we would risk exposing our flank to the Federal Government.\n\nPlan SELVA would shift our focus towards the native insurgents to the North. While their forces are scarce, they have the protection of the Amazonian Jungle to rely on, and it could prove a difficult campaign.\n\nFinally, some generals have proposed a plan APOCALIPSE, which would see an all-out assault on all fronts to leave no flank undefended and end the conflict as soon as possible. It could be a risky gamble however, as we'd risk getting overhelmed."
 Brazil.junta.3.a: "Eyes on the prize. The illegitimate government must come down."
 Brazil.junta.3.b: "The commies are weak and disorganized. They shall be our first target."
