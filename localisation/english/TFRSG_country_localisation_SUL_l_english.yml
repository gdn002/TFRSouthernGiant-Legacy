 Sul.1.t: "The South is Our Country at Last!"
 Sul.1.d: "It was nearly two centuries ago when General Antônio de Sousa Netto defeated the Brazilian imperial troops in the battle of Seival, proclaiming the Piratini Republic in Southern Brazil. This glorious young nation would survive and thrive for a whole decade before being unfairly reabsorbed by the Brazilian Empire as a result of the Poncho Verde Treaty, a black mark in our history. But the spirit of the Piratini Republic lived on, not only as part of our state flag, but in the hearts of our people who have always yearned for true sovereignty. Today, we have achieved this sovereignty and corrected the mistake of Poncho Verde, by proclaiming the Sul Republic, a nation we can call our own!\n\nAs the old ruling class picks itself apart over the carcass of the former nation that has claimed its control over us for so long, we shall take measures to ensure our independence is absolute this time around. State governments are already being reorganized and adapted to a new structure, school curriculums are being updated, and our people are being ensured that their integrity as citizens of the South will be secure.\n\nStill, just like last time, the old empire will eventually try to take what's rightfully ours and absorb us back into their bloated, corrupt establishment. Not this time. This time, the South shall forever be our country!"
 Sul.1.a: "This is our time."
 Sul.2.t: "The Question of Elections"
 Sul.2.d: "With our independence, comes the question of who should be in control of the new nation. Our former movement has managed to quickly retool itself into a proper provisional government under the command of our president Ivan Feloniuk, however we cannot ignore the fact that our mandate is fragile and while the cause of independence is a strong one, we cannot expect it to make up for the lack of a nation-building project. Fortunately, many of our patriotic leaders and civil servants have embraced our cause and began reorganizing into new political parties, each with their own ideas for the newborn nation. The people call for snap elections as they are eager to make their voices heard for the first time in their lives.\n\nStill, we cannot be too eager. The old Brazilian rulers may be busy fighting each other right now, but whoever emerges as the victor is guaranteed to set their sights upon us next. Many in our movement have advised against holding elections before this conflict is resolved and our independence is consolidated, as the people of the South need to be united more than ever right now."
 Sul.2.a: "The people of the South deserve to have their voices heard!"
 Sul.2.b: "We need unity more than ever right now!"
 Sul.3.t: "First Elections in the Sul Republic"
 Sul.3.d: "The news of emergency elections have had a rallying effect in our population. While many Southerners have been aprehensive about being under the authority of an entity they have not known much about until now, the announcement that emergency elections would be held combined with the presence of their familiar candidates in the ballots has brought back a sense of normalcy and a general feeling that this new nation belongs to them and not merely a cabal of power-grabbing separatists.\n\nWhile many new names have tried their luck getting into a political career in the new establishment, the main contenders for the position of the new head of state have come down to four familiar faces: On the left, the Southern Worker's Party is attempting to carve some space for social democracy in the new state, with PT affiliate Décio Lima having been selected as the main candidate. Former governor of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Eduardo Leite, has decided to run on PSDB's centrist liberal platform. On the right, the former Federal Judge and Justice Minister responsible for Lula's condemnation in 2017 Sérgio Moro has decided to take advantage of his reputation amongst reactionary voters and run under UNIÃO for president. And finally, what many consider to be this election's dud candidate, department store mogul Luciano Hang has decided to enter the political life under a dubious party established from his brand, Havan.\n\nThe electoral process has managed to be carried on with few disturbances, which has been fortunate given how much of it had to be improvised. Many of the former Brazilian electoral systems had to be adapted to the new reality, albeit the decision to ditch the eletronic voting systems in favor of paper ballots has been controversial. Still, with a much smaller land area and population to cover, the improvised elections were carried successfuly. The counting is just about to conclude, and the results are being confirmed..."
 Sul.3.a: "Décio Lima, of the Southern Worker's Party!"
 Sul.3.b: "Eduardo Leite, of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party!"
 Sul.3.c: "Sérgio Moro, of UNIÃO!"
 Sul.3.e: "Luciano Hang, of... Havan?"
 Sul.4.t: "Suspending Elections in The Sul Republic"
 Sul.4.d: "The decision to delay our first elections has not been an easy one. While our people are starved for true Southern representation, there are bigger threats to our North that we must address first. The three main factions of the Brazilian Civil War have thus far refused to recognize our independence or rescind their claims to our lands, thus we can expect them to pressure us back into their corrupt and decaying union in any way they can, and holding elections right now would leave us vulnerable to pro-Brazilian bad actors and influences.\n\nWhile major parts of our populace seems to have taken these news in good faith, we are receiving reports of fringe extremist groups that have been questioning our government and could be planning a coup. Our grasp to power, while just and rightful, is also fragile, so we can only count on the correct judgement of the Southern people to have faith in our cause and stay the course."
 Sul.4.a: "They have gotten us this far. We can trust their judgement."
 Sul.4.b: "It's time the workers of the South took control of their destiny!"
 Sul.4.c: "Enough. The South needs a strong leadership that will do whatever's necessary."
 Sulnews.1.t: "Southern Authority Suspends Elections Indefinitely"
 Sulnews.1.d: ""
 Sulnews.1.a: "Our independence comes first and foremost."
 Sulnews.1.b: "Wonder if the Southerners are happy with their \"independence\"."
 Sulnews.1.c: "A pathetic illegitimate government clinging onto power."
 Sulnews.1.e: "They have merely traded one group of elites for another."
 Sulnews.2.t: "Communist Militants Seize Power in The South"
 Sulnews.2.d: ""
 Sulnews.2.a: "The South belongs to the Southern workers!"
 Sulnews.2.b: "A Red South? Can't say I expected that."
 Sulnews.2.c: "Is there anywhere these dirty commies won't reach?"
 Sulnews.2.e: "The revolution has reached the South!"
 Sulnews.3.t: "Neo-Nazi Coup in The South"

 Sulnews.3.a: "The strong shall rise, and the weak shall be culled."
 Sulnews.3.b: "It can happen here...?"
 Sulnews.3.c: "A bunch of LARPers is what they are..."
 Sulnews.3.e: "Their fascist experiment shall be a short lived one!"
 Sulnews.4.t: "Décio Lima Elected President in The Sul Republic"

 Sulnews.4.a: "Here, we shall do social democracy right and free of corruption."
 Sulnews.4.b: "All of that, only to embrace the ideas they've always hated so much."
 Sulnews.4.c: "PT elected in the South??? They really have lost their minds."
 Sulnews.4.e: "A cry for help from the Southern workers."
 Sulnews.5.t: "Eduardo Leite Elected President in The Sul Republic"
 Sulnews.5.d: ""
 Sulnews.5.a: "The best path forward is a stable one."
 Sulnews.5.b: "Good for them?"
 Sulnews.5.c: "What did we expect?"
 Sulnews.5.e: "Clinging to the status quo, even in independence."
 Sulnews.6.t: "Sérgio Moro Elected President in The Sul Republic"
 Sulnews.6.d: ""
 Sulnews.6.a: "He shall bring justice and tradition to the South!"
 Sulnews.6.b: "Moro? That crooked judge?"
 Sulnews.6.c: "Ha! Now there's a real patriot!"
 Sulnews.6.e: "Our condolences in advance to the South's construction industry..."
 Sulnews.7.t: "Luciano Hang Elected President in The Sul Republic"
 Sulnews.7.d: ""
 Sulnews.7.a: "Can't go wrong with a successful businessman in charge!"
 Sulnews.7.b: "Is he going to turn the South into a giant Havan store?"
 Sulnews.7.c: "Can't wait to see where this goes."
 Sulnews.7.e: "They really elected a billionaire with no experience in politics?"
