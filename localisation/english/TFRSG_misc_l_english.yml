 #Ideologies
 integralism: "Integralism"
 integralism_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_Ideology_Integralism\n\n\n\n\n\n§YIntegralism§! is an interpretation of Catholic social teaching that argues its principles should be the basis of public law and policy within civil society. Integralism is also anti-pluralist, seeking the Catholic faith to be dominant in civil and religious matters and rejecting the secular state. Integralism can also refer to a set of theories that advocate a fully integrated social and political order based on a doctrine of human nature, focusing purely on achieving political and social integration, unity and uniformity even in non-Catholic contexts. As an intellectual and political movement, integralism emerged during the 19th and early 20th century polemics within the Catholic Church, especially in France, as an opposition to modernism and liberalism. Variants of integralism have also formed in Spain, Portugal and Brazil, with some maintaining a fringe following to this day."
